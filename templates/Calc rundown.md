Make a AP Calculus AB rundown on {{title}} in markdown format(make use of headings), use the LaTeX equation library format when writing equations(Try to only use block equations, which you do by having $$two dollar signs$$. For any topic that you believe needs its own independent explanation, enclose it in TWO brackets([[like this]], make sure they are just short titles for seperate notes)]].
