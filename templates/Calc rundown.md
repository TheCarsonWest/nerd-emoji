Make a calculus AB rundown on ____  in markdown format(make use of headings), use the LaTeX equation library format when writing equations. For any topic that you believe needs its own independent explanation, enclose it in TWO brackets([[like this]], make sure they are just short titles for seperate notes). If you want to include a graph, use this format
```desmos-graph
<insert LaTeX equation> 
<You can add multiple on new lines>
```
