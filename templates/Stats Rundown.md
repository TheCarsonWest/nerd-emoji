Make a AP Statistics note page on ({name}) in markdown format:
- make use of headings
- use the LaTeX equation library format when writing equations.($$Two dollar signs for a block equation$$, $One dollar sign for an inline equation$
- - There are already many other notes pages that you can reference by doing the [[double brackets]]. Enclosing them in double brackets like this will create a link to the page with that title for the user. Here is a list of all of the other topic that have already been written about
