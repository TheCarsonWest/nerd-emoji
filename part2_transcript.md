the ottoman turks began as a nomadic people from the step beyond the arab city for centuries they had wandered present day turkey looking for new pasture lands the muslim sultans had enlisted them as nice to fight off the mongol hordes but in the upheaval following the mongol invasion the turks began to stake out their own territorial claims and from their ranks emerged a warlord of legendary ambition his name was osman bey and it said that osman had a miraculous dream of a magical tree whose many branches foretold his soldering a powerful lineage one wonders how much of it is truth how much of it is legit it makes a lovely story and miracles are always more easy to digest than reality i don't think he realized that he was setting up such a fantastic dynasty a dynasty that was to rule the crucial link between three continents the followers of osman became known as ottomans they considered themselves warriors for the faith or gauzes whose destiny was to bring islam to the world guys were somewhat like freelancers who moved the empire forward either for ideology theology or for the sake of pure conquest they were probably very brave never thought about themselves or any harm that could come to the group by going into dangerous conditions but it made the ottoman empire almost fearless going into regions that nobody had been there before for the early ottomans the direction of expansion would always be to the west for good reason they could not expand to the east or to the south because those were controlled by their brothers that turkoman emirs the muslims and the muslims should not be fighting against muslims so they said at the time so the only place he could expand was towards the christian territories westward the osmond warriors moved to the north and west across the anatolian plateau into territory controlled by the traditional christian power in the area the ageing byzantines empire by osman time the thousand year old byzantium empire was reaching the end of it's age dwindling to an isolated stronghold in eurasia the crusaders had already wreaked havoc across the region on their way to jerusalem sacking the capital city and helping to reduce the once proud byzantium empire to a few small warring states the ottomans quickly overrun the splintered byzantines factions uniting northwestern anatolia into a single domain as in thirteen twenty six the ottomans took the powerful byzantine city of bursa a victory that would change the character of the ottoman turks forever the most important part of bursa was that it enabled osman and his descendants to establish a seat of the government the restless nomads of the step would settle down to build an empire what we're witnessing is this huge demographic event the movement of a whole civilization from a nomadic way of life to a settled way of life now when the ottomans took bursa and set it up as their capital they were very concerned to establish themselves as the rightful standard bearers of muslim civilization the civilization men's organization and the ottomans set out to manage the vast regions they now controlled after leaving the byzantium clerks in place they began to organize the new empire first and foremost taxation and record keeping the word bureaucracy has since lost it's noble connotations yet this was a great innovation as ambitious as any triumph in battle the ottomans are known for including and synthesising the cultural elements through the lands that they passed they are known for creating structures by which the peoples who lived there before could carry on their lives and their beliefs in the way that they chose in fact the ottomans had fewer conflicts with their christian subjects than those of their own faith muslim adversaries intent on challenging ottoman rule one of the bureaucratic or let us say management problems facing the ottomans was that there were still rival muslim sort of product kingdoms around them i mean they were conquered by the ottomans but they had old grudges to bear and they had certain claims to dynastic glory of their own and they were constantly worried about these old muslim families rising up and creating a rebellion and so the story goes that they felt it would be imprudent to have the army made up of these sorts of people and so they wanted to recruit children who were not connected with any rival muslim family and so they went into the balkans and they recruited primarily christian children this practice was called depth charmaine the young boys were technically slaves of the sultan but they weren't treated like slaves first they were brought into the muslim faith told rituals of washing and prayer and the arabic and ottoman languages this serve the political as well as a religious purpose through the dev sharma system the ottomans could create a cast without any conflicting loyalties to tribe or family the children had such great future that a lot of the times turks or even muslims pretended that their children were christian born and would registered them with the deaf hear now officials this system by so beautiful in that they only had one allegiance to the sultan no family late no region no other ties these children were then given the best possible education available in the world perhaps at the time and they were then able to move into the highest positions of power in the empire those who were brainy went to the palace schools and graduated into different levels of viziers and governors it even became grand vizier those who were brawny went to the january court the journey series with a sultan's elite infantry it was an army that would set the standard for centuries to come they were the strongest trained as military machines no fear of dying totally fearless and their only love was to serve the sultan they were trained with all the precision and discipline pomp and circumstance of a modern army for the first time an army wore uniforms and went into battle to the accompaniment of a military band the jenny series were the most feared troops in the western world a force that was worthy of this new islamic empire and it's restless visions of conquest the by the middle of the fifteenth century the ottoman empire spread from present day turkey known as anatolia deep into the balkans with one critical exception it must have goal the ottoman sultan that with his domains now stretching all the way into asia and far far into europe and the west they remained right in the centre of his domains the greatest prize of all the capital city of constantinople the most powerful there richest the most magnetic city in the entire world still in the hands of the dying but not yet dead byzantine empire to the ottomans constantinople is strategic and economic importance was considerable it's symbolic significance was even greater it was the city there was no other city if you were going to rule that area obviously he would rule it from that city and it said that the goal of laying claim to constantinople was decreed by muhammad himself every ottoman ruler since osman had wanted to seize the city but it had always remained firmly in christian hands then a sultan came to power whose dreams of conquest would not be denied history would honour him as mehmet the conqueror when he assumed the sultan aid he was only twelve years old but he was already well versed in ottoman politics to remove any threat of competition for power he had his half brother strangled the empire always meant everything more so than the family in order to stop the empire from splitting as had happened to other turkish dynasties ruling the islamic world when a young man became sultan upon the death of his father all the other brothers had to be eliminated this prevented segmentation of the empire it may have been cruel but it worked for the occupants went on the death of his father he finally then took over it meant an enormous change in the policy and direction of the ottoman empire and the direction of them much greater energy men met immediately set his sights on the one prize as grand as his ambitions mammoth had to conquer concessionaire but there was no other choice contact novel was sitting like a perfect gem or a perfect fruit waiting to be picked by the middle of the fifteenth century the city was a shadow of it's former self the population had plummeted from four hundred thousand to a mere fifty thousand but a besieging army would still be at a tremendous disadvantage constantinople was surrounded on three sides by water and massively forty five it was encircled by a triple ring of walls nearly one hundred feet high and thirty feet thick and they had already stood for a thousand years but men met had an answer for these walls i'm part of the military superiority of the ottomans came from their sophisticated and diverse use of the possibilities of gunpowder the siege of constantinople and fourteen fifty three on the amendment the conqueror saw the first dramatic application of this in the form of huge cannons that had not been seen before at which muhammad had specially commissioned for the occasion earlier cannons had been assembled with strips of forged metal bound with hoops they fired stone projectiles with little more power than a catapult the a new breed of cannons could be cast of solid bronze and packed with enough gunpowder to propel metal cannonballs with staggering force but memory was not staking his hopes on cannon alone the mile wide channel of the bosphorus strait was all that connected the city to the black sea if he could cut it off constantinople would be at his mercy the memory needed to construct a strategically positioned fortress to close the strait he built it right in the shadow of the great city walls it took less than four months to build a massive seven towered citadel called ruminate hisar i met himself is said to have carried stones during it's construction and no sooner was it completed than he tightened his noose around the neck of the bosphorus the first ship to defy his orders to stop was sunk it's crew decapitated and it's captain impaled on the castle walls the two stop nimitz ships from approaching the byzantines strung a massive chain across the strait the on april twenty second fourteen and fifty three the besieged city watched in horror as memory troops hoisted seventy of his ships ashore sliding them over land on greased planks past the barrier chain the more than one hundred thousand ottoman soldiers now stood before the walls of constantinople braced for the greatest bombardment the history of warfare had ever known and under relentless fire the city's seven thousand christian defenders held out for nearly a month in desperation the byzantines who occupied the city appealed to their fellow christians across the continent for help but of course europe in the fifteenth century was completely incapable of mounting any kind of a concerted opposition to the rising turkish threat mr and at that time the kings of europe had military and political problems of their own constantinople would have to fend for itself and shortly before dawn on may twenty ninth fourteen fifty three the turkish army breached the walls of the city within hours constantinople was in the hands of the ottomans mehmet road into the city and went straight to its most celebrated prize the magnificent church of higher sophia the built by the emperor justinian in the sixth century its name meant the church of holy wisdom it was the largest enclosed space in the world surely other groups of muslims and the ottomans themselves had come across many many churches they had seen churches before but they had never seen anything nobody had ever seen anything like i associate at the highest the fear or as sophia as it's called in turkish was one of the marvels of architectural marvels of the world it had the largest and highest dome in history and it was beautifully embellished with gold mosaics and the space is incredible the magnet it was a great putti inside the church a turkish voice rose proclaiming in arabic the first pillar of islam there is no god but god muhammad is his messenger miss me is the single greatest church in christendom was now a mosque man i was i yeah if the higher sophia became the inspiration for all ottoman domed mosques to come one would ever match it's size and scope and it belonged to mehmed the conqueror aw news of his triumph sent shockwaves around the world for europeans it was a concomitant disaster constantinople was after all the new rome it was constantine's capital city it was the symbol of christian dominance in the east the ottoman rulers had long stacked up titles for themselves khan which is turkish for emperor shahi shah persian for king of kings and sultan the arabic word for ruler but now with all the former byzantines empire under their command men met and his successors claimed yet another title holy roman emperor the ottomans had reached the gates of the west and were poised to push on towards what they now claimed as their ultimate destiny the conquest of europe that quest would fall to the most legendary sultan of all he was born at the beginning of the tenth century by the muslim calendar and he was the tenth sultan descended from osman he was a child of destiny whose greatness was expected in the parlance of the day he was the syp cut on the universal ruler the master of an auspicious conjunction whose coming has been foretold whose identity is confirmed astrologically his name was suleiman after solomon the wise king of the old testament the ottoman empire would reach it's apex under seulement rain mom was extremely well educated he was trained to the sultanate from the day he was born as a young prince he formed a relationship that will have a tremendous impact on his life and on the empire as well the menu was still crown prince he also developed a great friendship with a convert a greek convert who took the name ibrahim the two were very close in age and apparently very close in other ways personally intellectually ah educated together to to a certain extent and as was common practice when slave on acceded to the throne on the death of his father he took his facebook ibrahim with him to istanbul solomon was twenty six when he took the throne determined to make his mark on the world as soon as his ministers would let him in his early years lamont had to contend for example with grand visits and generals who simply refused to obey him feeling apparently that here was a twenty six year old kid who had never seen very much in the way of action and hadn't done very much to show that people ought to in fact obey him the way to prove his mettle was on the battlefield every new sultan was expected to begin his reign by expanding the empire the ottomans now controlled kurdistan egypt and the holiest cities of islam mecca and medina suleiman set his sights on belgrade in hungary the stepping stone to europe he was the head of the ottoman dynasty and he had certain duties to perform one was conquest and the first task sulaiman took upon himself a year after he ascended the ottoman throne list ahead towards belgrade and capture it belgrade was very important strategically because it was from there the army could move further on west a year later he turned his ambitions on the island of rhodes the tiny island was a troublesome outpost of christianity in an otherwise ottoman sea it was also a haven for pirates preying on muslim trade ships the fifty thousand defenders of rhodes manned one of the strongest faults in the world solomon decided on a tactic other than relying on gunfire from his huge cannons a new tactic seldom used until that time the ottomans are the first major force to actually develop new ways of harnessing gunpowder to the cause of military expansion in creative ways ottoman sappers dug out a series of fifty tunnels near the base of the fort said they could mine it's foundations performing this dangerous work were expendable christian conscripts from the balkans the resulting explosion signalled a furious six hour ottoman assault but the tugs were beaten back then after one hundred and forty five days of siege and the exhausted christian defenders finally negotiated a truce the ottomans had one the victory did more than deliver rhodes to the empire suleiman was now a seldom to be taken seriously his march of conquest had begun as europe grew to fear the name of suleiman but within his own borders he had another reputation islamic history remembers him as coonan the law giver arguments were really bureaucrats in the full sense of the word they kept every single record and in order to control the different peoples who participated in the world of the ottomans they had to have very carefully sorted out legal this steps and under suleiman a single legal system was defined for the sprawling empire his laws would later become the basis of constitutions for several other nations suleiman was the supreme monarch of the area he was the center of the world as he inaugurated a classical age in ottoman architecture commissioning some of the most spectacular buildings the world has ever seen as suleiman was in a unique position of wealth and and of consolidation and he focused his attention on developing monumental architecture to commemorate his great dynasty and himself great religious architecture can really give people a sense of what is at the heart of the faith grandeur and majesty are the things that come to mind when muslims think about god a building that is grand and magis majestic can immediately remind people of the glory of god suleiman chief architect sinan was a man whose vision perfectly complemented the empire builder sinan non perfected the signature structure of islam the domed mosque as his career spanned half a century and produced well over three hundred buildings including the refurbishment of one of the most important monuments in islam the dome of the rock in jerusalem at for this out enough goes he built his masterpiece destroy my knee at last in istanbul it is truly befitting seen on was called the great master these buildings were horrendously expensive huge things that took many many years to build and a great deal of architectural talent and engineering skill and engineering experience and they built a mosque like the silly manea they were doing it to say yeah i've got the power i've got the money i am the sultan i'm the king of kings but same time there was also tremendous spiritual value in these things the symbolism is not only that of empire but of faith and in the spirit of mohammed's teaching the great mosque was a centre of social services complete with a hospital school and library at it's inauguration it said suleiman gazed at it with awe and exclaimed oh solomon i have surpassed the the no less impressive was solomon's palace to copy was both the seat of government and his private dwelling the lay man was also a great patron of the arts and since the empire was very rich the best artisans were there so everything started flourishing the architecture or the art of his period show the first golden age of the ottoman world the everything that came out of his paradise is exquisite the man himself was a goldsmith the ottomans believe that every self did had to have a tangible trade being assaulted was not considered a practical or tangible trade and he was a very demanding patron insisted on checking the work even commissioned few things and i think each artisan group or each corps working for the palace tried to outdo one another to please the sultan because to play him had wonderful rewards the ottomans of course exercised quite a lot of influence on the european imagination and the royal and the political if you will ceremony and pomp of the ottomans was such that it would have humbled any citizen of the known world then and this was arguably one of the greatest world empires and european observers could not walk away without feeling of respect for the sheer power of the earth items the public seulement require that all those around him remain completely silent while he he made his wishes known with the slightest nod or gesture it must have been a tremendously impressive sight to see the courtyard of the palace filled with some six or seven thousand drama series and other functionaries no one saying a word what's going on here was the creation of a sovereignty so mysterious and yet so far reaching as to be seen as nearly divine as seulement power grew his lifelong friend abraham rose in the court structure and ibrahim pasha who became a pasha later on became his devoted grand vizier in fact he brought him married his sister so they were not on the good friends there were also a related an abraham campaign with his own army growing in influence and ambition till his power was second only to superman's the but for power and ambition the secret world of the sultan's hot him had no equal and contrary to the western stereotype it was not the sultan's playpen but lay at the centre of dynastic power the harem was the private quarters of the sultan we tend to think of the harem as where the women live but what it means is the place where you're not on display home is what it means islam allowed the sultan four wives and many concubines it was a system designed to produce heirs is what it was when you look into the actual details of how these things were carried out it was hardly anything terribly erotic i mean the sultan did not have much choice in his selection of female companions littleton was not in a position to look around and say i want her you know because his mother would have a lot to say about it the with his first wife solomon had a son and heir most afar but while he was in his mid thirties the sultan fell deeply in love with a slavic slave girl named her m in the west we know her by a different name rocks alana the rocks alana would bear him a rival heir and become seulement his most trusted confidant sultan was supposed to be protected from any undue influences he was supposed to be protected from any rivals and in a way this creates a vacuum around his person into which the harem life can enter and so the fact that he was so protected worked in a funny way to expose him to the influence of his female companions with whom he spent so much time and they were tremendously intelligent and ambitious women around him rattling around and being the most famous of all suleiman is a complex character a man that we know from his own life was capable of the tenderest emotions both toward his male friends and especially toward his his the great love of his life his wife who ran roams sultan and toward his family as well he he had a number of extremely talented sons on whom he lavished a great deal of affection the solomon groomed his firstborn son mustafa for power in the ottoman tradition the young prince entered the military and quickly won recognition as a talented general mustapha was clearly the heir apparent for suleiman the future of his empire seemed limitless i am god's slave and sultan of this world suleiman will call on a conquered fortress i suleiman in whose name the friday sermon is read in mecca and medina in baghdad i am the shar in the byzantine realms i am the caesar and in egypt the sultan he of course at the height of his powers clearly saw himself as dwarfing all his rivals and perhaps rightly so the one of solomon's greatest rivals was to the east the empire of the persians suffer ids this was a muslim enemy whose rival creed made them fierce antagonists of the ottomans for centuries the servants were also turkic in their ethnic origins and indeed spoke turkish as a language of daily life but they were moving into the muslim world unlike the ottomans who were moving into the west and so for the ottoman empire they formed side of the boundaries the easternmost boundaries of the ottoman rail as the safavid dynasty with shiite muslims bitter rivals to the sunni ottomans according to the shiites a leader had to be designated by his predecessor and had to be of the family of muhammad according to the sunday view it was not designation that was necessary and a person could be leaders of the community without being a direct descendant of muhammad and this challenge to legitimacy is the basis of the shiite sunni split a bitter division that still separates the muslim world to this day and i would say the ottomans never really thought of themselves so much as sunny until the savage came forth as this rival she the sound of these developed a rival ideology to the ottomans which then became an occasion for war over of course what wars are usually fought over wars are fought over land over wealth over territory over prestige in the south of these waged a war of ideology in eastern anatolia which was always for the ottomans the most worrisome part the terrain is difficult to conquer difficult control the safavid military was formidable but there were cultural rivals to the ottomans as well they were great patrons of the arts i think we know them more for their artistic patronage than of their great conquests and laws and systems and administration when you look at isfahan it is the most beautiful city in the world and that is the safavid city the safavid capital but it doesn't give you the same sense of power that the ottoman empire had or the ottoman capital hat is a different sense of power it's more eloquent perhaps more more precious in it's decoration and it's ceremonial spaces it's a totally different aspect of islam serve the art and architecture is is on a finer scale it's known it is known for its filigree is known for its intricate brushwork you know rather than for its stunning scale in the soaring palaces of the south of the shahs murderous intrigues against solomon and his dynasty were hatched that would reach into his very household oh but solomon's eyes were on the west where a fragmented and vulnerable europe awaited his conquest the ottoman empire encompassed everything from egypt to kurdistan and he now had hungary as well i but he had ambitions of going beyond that and actually bringing the larger portions of the world known to him if not all of it are under his control solomon's next step would be vienna its conquest would drive a dagger into the heart of the european habsburg empire and open the way to the west but as the heavily armed ottoman set out for vienna the weather turned against them the heavy cannon that had swept the ottomans to victory after victory bogged down in the mud suleiman had to move on without them with only light artillery the ottomans relentlessly shelled the city but the smallest breach was ferociously defended after a lengthy siege with winter fast approaching suleiman withdrew his forces he was not concerned he was sure he would return soon enough he never did superman's failure to take vienna was pivotal for europe it was the first major defeat after a long time the europeans had been losing and losing and losing and this was the dawn of a new day for europe but suleiman had little to fear from europe rival muslims suffer vids and his own family would bring the cruellest of sorrows to the sultan and ultimately to his empire as well as suleiman in some ways serves as a sort of epitome of the sixteenth century idea of the wise and just ruler who was at the same time a very tragic figure in the power laden world of the sultan's household the intrigues never ceased the topkapi palace as it was originally conceived had no quarters for the ladies the women lived in what was called the old palace but dram always complained about her husband as most wives would i spending too many days and months campaigning outside side the capital she kept saying she feels very lonely and the children miss him well surprisingly there was a fire in the old palace fire in her rams quarters so she had to be moved to the top of the palace temporarily while her old quarters were being renovated well she moved in and never moved out and now for 'em was at the center of power promoting her own son as heir apparent and immersing herself in a web of deadly gossip and suspicion she was incredibly devoted to her husband and any threat to sulaiman was a threat to her and she had to get rid of it the first threat came from ibrahim pasha who assumed titles that were only given to self test so iraq knew something was going to happen eventually and to protect the empire and the dynasty ibrahim pasha had to go and on march fifteenth fifteen thirty six suleiman and abraham pasha dined together as was their custom in the morning abraham his body was found strangled and but pseudomonas desolation and loss had only begun after a few years after abraham's death her em claim to have uncovered a plot to overthrow suleiman devised with suffer been helped by his beloved firstborn son and mustafa yeah this is a continuous problem in ottoman history sons trying to eventually replace their father this happens in one or monarchies succession could become a problem and it was an acute problem and sulaiman had his share of it and perhaps did not always play his hands right without hesitation suleiman ordered most staff as execution then cited by the young man's body for days refusing to allow anyone to touch him the best hope for the empire's future was dead when her m herself died the following year solomon fell deeper into despair finding solace in his poetry most of the poetry i think was written after he lost his wife since he talks about the loneliness of being in office that he has nobody left anymore and he's dying to join her even if your reign on the imperial throne seems have a lasting don't be taken in one day a hostile wind will blow and bring to your land of beauty heavens misfortune and deepest suffering in all his loneliness there was only one refuge for the sultan whose power like his sorrow seemed limitless he returned to the field of battle to the work of conquest he personally led thirteen campaigns the last one was at to get by witches and hungry now i think he knew that this was going to be his last campaign he personally led it knowing that he would not come back alive in fifteen sixty one the man who had ruled the empire longer than any other died and his grand war pavilion surrounded by his generals he was sixty seven no ottoman sultan would ever achieve his greatness again the nexus of world power would move from the mediterranean sea to the atlantic ocean and the new world slowly leaving the ottomans behind and istanbul today a
