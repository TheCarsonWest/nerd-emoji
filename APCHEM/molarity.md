Molarity is a measure of the concentration of a solution, defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. It is expressed in units of moles per liter (mol/L).

### **Calculating Molarity**

To calculate the [[molarity]] of a solution, use the following formula:

```
Molarity = Moles of Solute / Volume of Solution (in liters)
```

#### **Example:**

If you have 0.5 moles of NaCl dissolved in 2 liters of water, the [[molarity]] of the solution is:

```
Molarity = 0.5 moles / 2 liters = 0.25 mol/L
```

### **Diluting [[AP CHEM solutions]]**

When diluting a solution, the total number of moles of solute remains the same. However, the volume of the solution increases, resulting in a decrease in [[molarity]].

#### **Dilution Formula:**

## $$
M_1V_1 = M_2V_2
$$
* $M_1$ is the initial [[molarity]]
* $V_1$ is the initial volume
* $M_2$ is the final [[molarity]]
* $V_2$ is the final volume

**Example:**

If you have 500 mL of a 1.0 M NaCl solution and want to dilute it to a final volume of 1 liter, the final [[molarity]] will be:

$$
(1.0 \; M)(500 \; mL) = (M_2)(1000 \; mL)
$$$$
 M_2 = 0.5\; M
$$

**Stoichiometry and Molarity**

Molarity can be used in stoichiometric calculations to determine the number of moles of reactants or products involved in a chemical reaction.

**Example:**

If you have 100 mL of a 0.1 M HCl solution and react it with 100 mL of a 0.1 M NaOH solution, the reaction will produce NaCl and water. The moles of HCl and NaOH used are:

```
Moles of HCl = (0.1 mol/L)(100 mL) = 0.01 mol
Moles of NaOH = (0.1 mol/L)(100 mL) = 0.01 mol
```

**Additional Notes:**

* Molarity is temperature-dependent.
* Molarity can be converted to other concentration units, such as normality (N) and parts per million (ppm).
* Molarity is a useful measure of concentration for many chemical applications, including titrations, dilutions, and stoichiometric calculations.
