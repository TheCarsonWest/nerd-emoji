**Key Concepts:**

* **Rate of Reaction:**  The change in concentration of reactants or products per unit time.  Expressed as $ \frac{-\Delta[reactant]}{\Delta t} $ or $ \frac{\Delta[product]}{\Delta t} $.  The negative sign for reactants indicates that their concentration decreases over time.

* **Rate Law:**  An equation that relates the rate of a reaction to the concentrations of reactants raised to certain powers.  General form:  $rate = k[A]^m[B]^n$, where:
    * $k$ is the rate constant (temperature dependent).
    * $[A]$ and $[B]$ are the concentrations of reactants.
    * $m$ and $n$ are the reaction orders with respect to A and B, respectively (determined experimentally).  The overall reaction order is $m + n$.

* **Reaction Order:**  The exponent of a reactant's concentration in the rate law.  It indicates how the rate changes as the concentration of that reactant changes.  [[Reaction Orders Explained]]

* **Rate Constant (k):**  A proportionality constant relating the rate of a reaction to the concentrations of reactants. Its value depends on temperature and the activation energy of the reaction.  The Arrhenius equation describes this relationship: $k = Ae^{-Ea/RT}$, where:
    * $A$ is the frequency factor (pre-exponential factor)
    * $E_a$ is the activation energy
    * $R$ is the gas constant
    * $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin

* **Integrated Rate Laws:** Equations that relate the concentration of a reactant to time.  The form of the integrated rate law depends on the reaction order:

    * **Zero-order:** $[A]_t = -kt + [A]_0$
    * **First-order:** $\ln[A]_t = -kt + \ln[A]_0$  or $[A]_t = [A]_0e^{-kt}$
    * **Second-order:** $\frac{1}{[A]_t} = kt + \frac{1}{[A]_0}$

    [[Integrated Rate Laws and Half-life]]

* **Half-life ($t_{1/2}$):** The time it takes for the concentration of a reactant to decrease to half its initial value.  The expression for half-life depends on the reaction order:

    * **Zero-order:** $t_{1/2} = \frac{[A]_0}{2k}$
    * **First-order:** $t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k}$
    * **Second-order:** $t_{1/2} = \frac{1}{k[A]_0}$

* **Collision Theory:**  A theory that explains reaction rates in terms of the collisions between reactant molecules.  Only collisions with sufficient energy (greater than the activation energy) and proper orientation lead to a reaction.

* **Reaction Mechanisms:** A series of elementary steps that describe the overall reaction. [[Reaction Mechanisms and Elementary Steps]]


* **Rate-Determining Step:** The slowest step in a reaction mechanism. It determines the overall rate of the reaction.

* **Catalysts:** Substances that increase the rate of a reaction without being consumed in the reaction. They lower the activation energy by providing an alternative reaction pathway. [[Catalysts and Catalysis]]


* **Experimental Determination of Rate Laws:**  Techniques like initial rates method and isolation method are used to determine the rate law experimentally. [[Determining Rate Laws Experimentally]]
