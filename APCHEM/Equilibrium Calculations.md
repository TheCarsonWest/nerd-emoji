This section covers various calculations related to chemical equilibrium.  Key concepts include $K_c$, $K_p$, and their relationship, ICE tables, and manipulation of equilibrium expressions.

**1. [[Equilibrium]] Constant ($K$)**

*   $K_c$: [[Equilibrium]] constant expressed in terms of molar concentrations.  For the generic reaction: $aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD$,  $K_c = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$
*   $K_p$: [[Equilibrium]] constant expressed in terms of partial pressures.  Used for gaseous reactions.  $K_p = \frac{(P_C)^c(P_D)^d}{(P_A)^a(P_B)^b}$
*   Relationship between $K_p$ and $K_c$: $K_p = K_c(RT)^{\Delta n}$, where $\Delta n$ is the change in the number of moles of gas (moles of gaseous products - moles of gaseous reactants), R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

**2. [[ICE Tables]]**

ICE tables (Initial, Change, [[Equilibrium) are used to organize information and solve equilibrium problems.  They are essential for calculating equilibrium concentrations. ICE Table Examples]]]]

**3. Calculating [[Equilibrium]] Concentrations**

This involves using the equilibrium expression ($K_c$ or $K_p$) and the ICE table to solve for unknown concentrations.  Often requires solving quadratic or cubic equations. [[Solving Equilibrium Equations]]

**4. Reaction Quotient (Q)**

The reaction quotient, $Q$, is calculated the same way as $K$, but using non-equilibrium concentrations.

*   $Q < K$: The reaction will proceed to the right (towards products) to reach equilibrium.
*   $Q > K$: The reaction will proceed to the left (towards reactants) to reach equilibrium.
*   $Q = K$: The reaction is at equilibrium.

**5. [[Le Chatelier's Principle]]**

Le Chatelier's principle predicts the effect of changes in conditions (temperature, pressure, concentration) on an equilibrium system. [[Le Chatelier's Principle]]

**6.  Manipulating [[Equilibrium]] Expressions**

*   Reversing a reaction: Inverses the value of K.  $K_{reverse} = \frac{1}{K_{forward}}$
*   Multiplying a reaction by a factor: Raises K to the power of that factor.  $K_{new} = K_{original}^n$
*   Adding reactions:  Multiply the K values of individual reactions to get the K value for the overall reaction.

**7.  Weak Acid/Base Equilibria**

Calculations involving the ionization of weak acids and bases.  Involves using the $K_a$ and $K_b$ values. [[Weak Acid/Base Calculations]]

**8. Solubility Equilibria**

Calculations involving the solubility of sparingly soluble salts.  Involves using the $K_{sp}$ value. [[Solubility Equilibria Calculations]]
