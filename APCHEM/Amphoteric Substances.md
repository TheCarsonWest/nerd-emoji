# [[Amphoteric Substances]]

Amphoteric substances can act as both acids and bases.  This means they can donate or accept a proton ($H^+$) depending on the reaction conditions.

**Key Characteristics:**

* Can react with both acids and bases.
* Often contain a molecule with both acidic and basic functional groups.
* The behavior depends on the relative strength of the acid and base it is reacting with.

**Examples:**

* **Water ($H_2O$)**:  $H_2O + H^+ \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+$ (acts as a base) ;  $H_2O \rightleftharpoons H^+ + OH^-$ (acts as an acid)
* **Amino acids:** Contain both carboxyl (-COOH) groups (acidic) and amino (-$NH_2$) groups (basic).
* **Hydrogen carbonate ion ($HCO_3^-$)**: $HCO_3^- + H^+ \rightleftharpoons H_2CO_3$ (acts as a base) ; $HCO_3^- \rightleftharpoons H^+ + CO_3^{2-}$ (acts as an acid)
* **Aluminum hydroxide ($Al(OH)_3$)**: Reacts with acids to form salts and water, and with bases to form aluminates.

**Reactions:**

* **With Acids:**  An amphoteric substance acts as a base, accepting a proton.  For example:  $Al(OH)_3(s) + 3HCl(aq) \rightarrow AlCl_3(aq) + 3H_2O(l)$
* **With Bases:** An amphoteric substance acts as an acid, donating a proton. For example: $Al(OH)_3(s) + NaOH(aq) \rightarrow NaAl(OH)_4(aq)$

**Further points to consider:**

* The pH at which an amphoteric substance exhibits acidic or basic character.
* How the structure of the molecule influences its amphoteric nature.
* The equilibrium constants for the acid and base reactions of amphoteric substances.
