# [[[[Equilibrium]]]]
# [[ICE Tables]]

ICE tables are used to solve equilibrium problems.  They stand for **I**nitial, **C**hange, and **E**quilibrium.

**Format:**

|             | Reactant A | Reactant B | Product C |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **I**nitial  |     $x_A$     |     $x_B$     |      $x_C$    |
| **C**hange   |    $\Delta x_A$   |    $\Delta x_B$   |    $\Delta x_C$  |
| **E**quilibrium| $x_A + \Delta x_A$| $x_B + \Delta x_B$| $x_C + \Delta x_C$|


Where $x_A$, $x_B$, and $x_C$ are the initial concentrations (or partial pressures) of A, B, and C respectively.  $\Delta x_A$, $\Delta x_B$, and $\Delta x_C$ represent the change in concentration (or partial pressure) during the reaction to reach equilibrium.  The equilibrium concentrations are found by summing the initial and change values.


**Example:**

Consider the reaction:  $N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g)$

Let's say we start with 1.0 M $N_2$ and 1.5 M $H_2$, and at equilibrium, we have 0.6 M $NH_3$.  We can set up the ICE table as follows:

|             | $N_2$       | $3H_2$      | $2NH_3$     |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **I**nitial  |  1.0 M      |  1.5 M      |   0 M       |
| **C**hange   |  $-x$       |  $-3x$      |  $+2x$      |
| **E**quilibrium| $1.0 - x$   | $1.5 - 3x$  |   $2x$      |

Since we know the equilibrium concentration of $NH_3$ is 0.6 M, we can solve for $x$:

$2x = 0.6 M$  $\implies x = 0.3 M$

Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations are:

$[N_2] = 1.0 - 0.3 = 0.7 M$
$[H_2] = 1.5 - 3(0.3) = 0.6 M$
$[NH_3] = 0.6 M$


**Important Considerations:**

*   The stoichiometric coefficients are crucial in determining the changes in concentration.
*   The change in concentration is always negative for reactants and positive for products.
*   The equilibrium constant ($K$) expression can be used to solve for unknown values in the ICE table. [[[[Equilibrium]] Constants]]
*   For problems involving small $K$ values, we can often use approximations to simplify the calculations. [[Approximations in Equilibrium]] Calculations]]]]
