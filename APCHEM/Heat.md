## [[Heat]]

[[Heat]] (q) is the transfer of thermal energy between objects at different temperatures.  [[Heat]] flows spontaneously from a hotter object to a colder object until thermal equilibrium is reached.  [[Heat]] is measured in Joules ([[J]]) or calories (cal).  The relationship between heat and [[Temperature]] change is given by:

$$q = mc\Delta T$$

where:

* q = heat transferred
* m = mass of the substance
* c = specific heat capacity (the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of [[1 gram of a substance by [[1°C)
* ΔT = change in temperature (final temperature - initial temperature)
