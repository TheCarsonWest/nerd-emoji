# Heat

Heat (q) is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies at different temperatures.  It's a form of energy in transit, and its transfer continues until thermal equilibrium (equal temperatures) is reached. Heat is measured in Joules (J) or calories (cal).  The direction of heat flow is always from a hotter object to a colder object.  Important equations include:

* **q = mcΔT:**  where q is heat, m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.  This equation applies to systems undergoing constant pressure.
