# [[Distillation]]
# [[AP CHEM solutions]] [[Azeotropes]] are mixtures of two or more liquids whose proportions cannot be altered by simple [[Distillation]].  This occurs because the vapor phase has the same composition as the liquid phase at a specific boiling point.  In essence, the liquid and vapor behave as a single component, making separation by [[Distillation]] impossible.

## Types of [[Azeotropes]] 
There are two main types:

* **Minimum-boiling azeotropes:** These boil at a lower temperature than either of their pure components.  The [[intermolecular forces]] between the components are weaker than those within the pure components, leading to a lower boiling point.  An example is ethanol and water (95.[[6]]% ethanol).

* **Maximum-boiling azeotropes:** These boil at a higher temperature than either of their pure components.  Stronger [[intermolecular forces]] between the components than within the pure components result in a higher boiling point.  An example is hydrochloric acid and water.


## [[Vapor Pressure]] and [[Raoults Law]] Deviation

Understanding azeotropes requires examining deviations from [[Raoults Law]].  [[Raoults Law]] states that the [[partial pressure]] of a component in an ideal solution is proportional to its mole fraction and its [[vapor pressure]] in the pure state:

$P_i = x_i P_i^*$

where:

* $P_i$ is the [[partial pressure]] of component $i$
* $x_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$
* $P_i^*$ is the [[vapor pressure]] of pure component $i$
 [[Azeotropes]] form because of significant deviations from [[Raoults Law]].  These deviations can be:

* **Positive deviations:**  The [[intermolecular forces]] between unlike molecules are weaker than those between like molecules.  This leads to a higher total [[vapor pressure]] than predicted by [[Raoults Law]], resulting in minimum-boiling azeotropes.

* **Negative deviations:** The [[intermolecular forces]] between unlike molecules are stronger than those between like molecules. This leads to a lower total [[vapor pressure]] than predicted by [[Raoults Law]], resulting in maximum-boiling azeotropes.


## Breaking [[Azeotropes]] 
Since simple [[Distillation]] fails, other methods are needed to separate azeotropic mixtures:

* **Pressure-swing [[Distillation]]:** Changing the pressure alters the azeotropic composition, allowing for separation through multiple [[Distillation]] steps at different pressures.

* **Adding a third component (entrainer):** An entrainer is added to form a new azeotrope with one of the original components, making separation possible.

* **Membrane separation:**  Utilizing selective membranes to separate components based on differences in their size or properties.
