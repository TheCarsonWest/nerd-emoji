# [[Water as an Acid and Base]]

Water is amphoteric, meaning it can act as both an acid and a base.  This is due to its ability to donate and accept protons ($H^+$).

* **Water as an acid:**  Water can donate a proton to a stronger base.
   $H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$  
   In this reaction, water acts as a Brønsted-Lowry acid, donating a proton to form the hydroxide ion ($OH^-$).

* **Water as a base:** Water can accept a proton from a stronger acid.
   $H_2O(l) + H^+(aq) \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+(aq)$
   Here, water acts as a Brønsted-Lowry base, accepting a proton to form the hydronium ion ($H_3O^+$).

## $$K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \text{ at 25}^\circ C$$

The ion product constant for water ($K_w$) describes the equilibrium constant for the autoionization of water.  At 25°C, $K_w$ is $1.0 \times 10^{-14}$. This means that in pure water, $[H^+]=[OH^-]=1.0 \times 10^{-7}$ M.

* **pH and pOH:**
    * $pH = -\log[H^+]$
    * $pOH = -\log[OH^-]$
    * $pH + pOH = 14$ (at 25°C)

**Further Notes:**

* The value of $K_w$ changes with temperature.  At higher temperatures, $K_w$ increases, indicating that the autoionization of water is endothermic.

*  The autoionization of water is an important concept for understanding many acid-base reactions and calculations in aqueous solutions.
