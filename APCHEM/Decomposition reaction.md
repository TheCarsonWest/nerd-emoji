**Decomposition Reactions**

**Definition:** A decomposition reaction is a chemical reaction in which a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances.

**General Equation:**

$$AB \rightarrow A + B$$

**Types of Decomposition Reactions:**

* **Thermal Decomposition:** Occurs when a compound breaks down due to the absorption of heat.
* **Photodecomposition:** Occurs when a compound breaks down due to the absorption of light energy.
* **Electrolytic Decomposition:** Occurs when a compound breaks down when an electric current is passed through it.

**Factors Affecting Decomposition Reactions:**

* **Temperature:** Higher temperatures generally increase the rate of decomposition.
* **Surface Area:** Increasing the surface area of the reactant increases the rate of decomposition.
* **Pressure:** Pressure has little effect on decomposition reactions involving gases.
* **Catalysts:** Catalysts can increase the rate of decomposition by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy.

**Examples:**

* **Thermal Decomposition of Calcium Carbonate:**

$$CaCO_3(s) \xrightarrow{\text{heat}} CaO(s) + CO_2(g)$$

* **Photodecomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide:**

$$2H_2O_2(aq) \xrightarrow{\text{light}} 2H_2O(l) + O_2(g)$$

* **Electrolytic Decomposition of Water:**

$$2H_2O(l) \xrightarrow{\text{electricity}} 2H_2(g) + O_2(g)$$

**Applications:**

* Decomposition reactions are used in a variety of industrial processes, such as:
    * Production of metals from their ores
    * Production of gases
    * Purification of substances
* Decomposition reactions also occur naturally, such as in the digestion of food and the decay of organic matter.
