# [[Acids and Bases]]
# [[Acid Dissociation Constant]]

The acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, is a quantitative measure of the strength of an acid in solution.  It represents the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an acid, HA, into its conjugate base, $A^-$, and a proton, $H^+$.

## $$HA(aq) \rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + A^-(aq)$$

The expression for $K_a$ is:

## $$K_a = \frac{[H^+]][A^-]]}{[HA]]}$$

where $[H^+]]$, $[A^-]]$, and $[HA]]$ represent the equilibrium concentrations of the hydrogen ion, conjugate base, and the undissociated acid, respectively.

A larger $K_a$ value indicates a stronger acid, meaning it dissociates more readily.  A smaller $K_a$ value indicates a weaker acid.  $pK_a$, which is defined as $pK_a = -\log_{10} K_a$, is often used instead of $K_a$ because it is easier to manage numerically.  A smaller $pK_a$ value indicates a stronger acid.

[[Weak Acids and Bases]]  These notes will cover the characteristics of weak acids and bases and how to calculate their pH using the $K_a$ and $K_b$ values.  This will include ICE tables and approximations.

[[Polyprotic Acids]]  This will focus on acids that can donate more than one proton and how to calculate the different $K_a$ values and their influence on pH.

[[Titration Curves]]  This will explain how to interpret titration curves involving weak acids and relate them to $K_a$ and $pK_a$.

[[Buffers]]  This will discuss buffer solutions, their capacity, and how the $K_a$ of the weak acid component is relevant to their effectiveness.  It will cover the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

[[Relationship between $K_a$ and $K_b$]] This section will explain the mathematical relationship between the acid dissociation constant ($K_a$) and the base dissociation constant ($K_b$) for a conjugate acid-base pair.  This involves the ion-product constant for water, $K_w$.
