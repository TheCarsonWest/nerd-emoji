## [[London Dispersion]]: Dipoles randomly form because an electron randomly stepped out of place
- Occurs in ALL molecules
- $H_2$ is a perfectly polar molecule, but sometimes an electron will step out of place, making one side positive and one side negative, causing attraction and repulsion.
- [[Polarizability]] affects how MUCH london dispersion something has
# Water is weird
It has a way higher BP than it should according to everything I just said. This is because of surface tension from [[hydrogen bonds]]
