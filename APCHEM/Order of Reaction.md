The order of a reaction describes how the rate of a reaction depends on the concentration of each reactant. It's an experimentally determined value and doesn't necessarily correlate with the stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation.  Understanding reaction order is crucial for predicting how changes in concentration affect the reaction rate and for determining the rate law.
# [[Finding reaction order]]

## Types of Orders

Reactions can exhibit different orders with respect to each reactant, and the overall reaction order is the sum of these individual orders.

* **Zero Order:** The rate of the reaction is independent of the reactant's concentration.  Doubling the concentration has no effect on the rate.
* **First Order:** The rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the reactant's concentration. Doubling the concentration doubles the rate.
* **Second Order:** The rate of the reaction is proportional to the square of the reactant's concentration. Doubling the concentration quadruples the rate.
* **Higher Orders:**  While less common, reactions can have orders greater than two.  The rate is proportional to the concentration raised to the power of the order.
* **Fractional Orders:** Some reactions exhibit fractional orders, indicating complex mechanisms. [[Reaction Mechanisms]]


## [[Rate Laws]]

The rate law is a mathematical expression that relates the rate of a reaction to the concentrations of the reactants and the rate constant (k).  The general form is:

$Rate = k[A]^m[B]^n$

Where:

* *Rate* is the reaction rate (usually expressed in M/s or mol/L*s)
* *k* is the rate constant (units depend on the overall reaction order)
* *[A]* and *[B]* are the molar concentrations of reactants A and B
* *m* and *n* are the orders of the reaction with respect to A and B, respectively.  These are experimentally determined.

The overall reaction order is the sum of *m* and *n*.

## Determining Reaction Order

Several methods are used to determine the reaction order:

* **Method of Initial Rates:**  [[Method of Initial Rates]] This involves running multiple experiments with varying initial concentrations of reactants and measuring the initial rate for each.  By comparing how the rate changes with concentration, the orders can be determined.
* **Integrated [[Rate Laws]]:** [[Integrated Rate Laws]]  These equations relate the concentration of a reactant to time. By plotting concentration vs. time data in various forms (e.g., ln[A] vs. time for a first-order reaction), the order can be determined from the linearity of the plot.
* **Half-life Method:** [[Half-life]] The half-life of a reaction is the time it takes for the concentration of a reactant to decrease by half.  The relationship between half-life and initial concentration is indicative of the reaction order.


## Rate Constant (k)

The rate constant, *k*, is a proportionality constant that relates the rate of a reaction to the concentrations of the reactants. It is [[Temperature]]-dependent ([[Arrhenius Equation]]) and specific to a particular reaction. The units of *k* vary depending on the overall reaction order.


## Example

Consider the reaction: $2NO(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2NO_2(g)$

If experimentally determined rate law is: $Rate = k[NO]^2[O_2]$

* The reaction is second order with respect to NO.
* The reaction is first order with respect to O<sub>2</sub>.
* The overall reaction order is 3 (2 + 1).


## Factors Affecting Reaction Rate

Besides reactant concentrations, several factors influence reaction rate:

* **[[Temperature]]:**  Increasing [[Temperature]] generally increases reaction rate.
* **Surface Area:** For heterogeneous reactions (involving different phases), increasing the surface area of the solid reactant increases the rate.
* **Catalysts:** [[Catalysts]]  Catalysts increase the rate of a reaction without being consumed themselves.
* **Nature of Reactants:** The inherent reactivity of the reactants plays a role.
