# [[chemical reactions]]
Reaction mechanisms detail the step-by-step process by which a chemical reaction occurs.  They describe the exact sequence of bond breaking and bond forming events, including the formation of any intermediate species. Understanding reaction mechanisms is crucial for predicting [[Reaction Rates]], product distributions, and the effects of reaction conditions.

## Key Concepts

* **Elementary Steps:** These are the individual steps in a reaction mechanism. Each elementary step involves a single molecular event, such as a collision between two molecules.  The rate law for an elementary step can be directly determined from its stoichiometry.

* **Molecularity:** This refers to the number of molecules involved in an elementary step.  Common types include:
    * **Unimolecular:** One molecule undergoes a change ($A \rightarrow products$)
    * **Bimolecular:** Two molecules collide and react ($A + B \rightarrow products$)
    * **Termolecular:** Three molecules collide simultaneously (rare).

* **Rate-Determining Step (RDS):** This is the slowest step in a reaction mechanism. The overall rate of the reaction is determined by the rate of this slowest step. [[Rate Laws]]

* **Intermediates:** These are species that are formed in one elementary step and consumed in a subsequent step. They do not appear in the overall balanced equation.

* **Catalysts:** These increase the rate of a reaction without being consumed themselves. They do this by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower [[Activation Energy]].  Catalysts often participate in multiple elementary steps, ultimately being regenerated. [[Catalysis]]

* **Reaction Coordinate Diagram:** A graphical representation showing the energy changes that occur during a reaction. It shows the energy of the reactants, products, intermediates, and the [[Activation Energy]] ($E_a$) for each step.  The highest point on the diagram represents the transition state.

## Example: The Reaction of Hydrogen and Bromine

The reaction between hydrogen and bromine to form hydrogen bromide is a classic example of a reaction with a complex mechanism.  The overall reaction is:

$H_2(g) + Br_2(g) \rightarrow 2HBr(g)$

A simplified mechanism is:

[[1]]. **Initiation:** $Br_2(g) \rightarrow 2Br\cdot(g)$ (slow, unimolecular)
[[2]]. **Propagation:**
    * $Br\cdot(g) + H_2(g) \rightarrow HBr(g) + H\cdot(g)$
    * $H\cdot(g) + Br_2(g) \rightarrow HBr(g) + Br\cdot(g)$
[[3]]. **Termination:**
    * $2Br\cdot(g) \rightarrow Br_2(g)$
    * $H\cdot(g) + Br\cdot(g) \rightarrow HBr(g)$
    * $2H\cdot(g) \rightarrow H_2(g)$


In this mechanism:

* $Br\cdot$ and $H\cdot$ are intermediates (free radicals).
* The initiation step is slow and rate-determining.
* Propagation steps continue the reaction, generating more product.
* Termination steps consume the radicals, ending the chain reaction.

The rate law derived from this mechanism is complex and not simply based on the stoichiometry of the overall reaction. This highlights the importance of considering the mechanism to understand the reaction kinetics.


##  Determining [[Reaction Mechanisms]] 
Determining the precise mechanism of a reaction is challenging.  Experimental techniques such as:

* **Kinetic studies:** Measuring reaction rates under varying conditions (concentrations, [[Temperature]]) to determine the rate law.
* **Isotopic labeling:** Using isotopes to track the movement of atoms during the reaction.
* **Spectroscopic techniques:** Observing the formation and disappearance of intermediates.

are used to gather evidence that supports a proposed mechanism.  Note that a proposed mechanism is a model; it may be refined or revised as new experimental data become available.


## Conclusion

Reaction mechanisms are essential for a deep understanding of [[chemical reactions]]. They provide a detailed picture of the events occurring at a molecular level, allowing for the prediction and manipulation of reaction outcomes.  By studying reaction mechanisms, we can gain valuable insights into the factors that govern reaction rates and selectivities, which is crucial in many areas of chemistry.
