# Enthalpy

Enthalpy (H) is a thermodynamic state function representing the total heat content of a system at constant pressure.  It's difficult to measure directly, but changes in enthalpy (ΔH) are readily measurable.  ΔH represents the heat absorbed or released during a process at constant pressure.

* **ΔH = H<sub>products</sub> - H<sub>reactants</sub>**

A positive ΔH indicates an endothermic process (heat absorbed), while a negative ΔH indicates an exothermic process (heat released).  Standard enthalpy changes (ΔH°) are measured under standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm).
