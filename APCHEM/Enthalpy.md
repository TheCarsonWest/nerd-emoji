## [[Enthalpy]]
# **[[Enthalpy]] = ΔH**

[[Enthalpy]] (H) is a thermodynamic state function representing the total heat content of a system at constant pressure.  The change in enthalpy (ΔH) during a reaction is the heat absorbed or released at constant pressure.  A negative ΔH indicates an [[Exothermic]] reaction (heat is released), while a positive ΔH indicates an endothermic reaction (heat is absorbed).  [[Enthalpy]] changes are often determined experimentally using calorimetry.
