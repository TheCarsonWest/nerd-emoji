- The energy change from when an atom gains an electron to form a negative ion
- Can be **Exothermic or endothermic**
	- Metals
		- Easier to lose than gain
		- Usually endothermic, or slightly exothermic
	- Nonmetals
		- Easier to gain electrons
			- Adding electrons is exothermic, affinity is negative because it releases energy
