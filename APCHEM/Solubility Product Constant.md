# Solubility Product Constant (K<sub>sp</sub>) - AP Chemistry Rundown

## Introduction

The solubility product constant (K<sub>sp</sub>) is a crucial concept in AP Chemistry that describes the equilibrium between a solid ionic compound and its dissolved ions in a saturated solution.  A saturated solution is one where the maximum amount of solute has been dissolved at a given temperature.  It's important to remember that K<sub>sp</sub> applies only to *slightly soluble* or *insoluble* ionic compounds, not to readily soluble ones.

## Definition

The K<sub>sp</sub> is the equilibrium constant for the dissolution of a solid ionic compound in water. Consider a generic ionic compound A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub>(s):

$A_xB_y(s) \rightleftharpoons xA^{y+}(aq) + yB^{x-}(aq)$

The solubility product constant expression is given by:

$K_{sp} = [A^{y+}]^x[B^{x-}]^y$

Where:

* $[A^{y+}]$ and $[B^{x-}]$ represent the molar concentrations of the respective ions at equilibrium.
* *x* and *y* are the stoichiometric coefficients of the balanced dissolution equation.

**Important Note:** The solid reactant, A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub>(s), is *not* included in the K<sub>sp</sub> expression because its concentration is effectively constant.

## Factors Affecting K<sub>sp</sub>

* **Temperature:** K<sub>sp</sub> is temperature-dependent.  Generally, the solubility of solids increases with increasing temperature, thus increasing K<sub>sp</sub>. [[Temperature and Solubility]]
* **Common Ion Effect:** The presence of a common ion in the solution decreases the solubility of the slightly soluble salt, thus shifting the equilibrium to the left. [[Common Ion Effect]]
* **pH:** The solubility of some salts, particularly those containing basic anions (e.g., hydroxides, sulfides, carbonates), is affected by the pH of the solution. [[pH and Solubility]]
* **Complex Ion Formation:** The formation of complex ions can significantly increase the solubility of a metal salt. [[Complex Ion Equilibria]]

## Calculating K<sub>sp</sub>

K<sub>sp</sub> can be calculated from the molar solubility (s) of the compound, which is the number of moles of the compound that dissolve per liter of saturated solution.  The relationship between K<sub>sp</sub> and molar solubility depends on the stoichiometry of the dissolution reaction.

**Example:**

For the compound MX(s) dissolving in water:

$MX(s) \rightleftharpoons M^+(aq) + X^-(aq)$

$K_{sp} = [M^+][X^-] = (s)(s) = s^2$

For the compound MX<sub>2</sub>(s) dissolving in water:

$MX_2(s) \rightleftharpoons M^{2+}(aq) + 2X^-(aq)$

$K_{sp} = [M^{2+}][X^-]^2 = (s)(2s)^2 = 4s^3$

## Relationship between K<sub>sp</sub> and Solubility

A larger K<sub>sp</sub> value indicates higher solubility.  However, direct comparison of K<sub>sp</sub> values to determine relative solubilities is only valid for compounds with the *same stoichiometry* (e.g., MX and MY, but not MX and MY<sub>2</sub>).

## Predicting Precipitation

The ion product (Q) can be used to predict whether precipitation will occur when two solutions containing ions are mixed.  Q is calculated in the same way as K<sub>sp</sub> but using the initial ion concentrations.

* **Q < K<sub>sp</sub>:** The solution is unsaturated, and no precipitation will occur.
* **Q = K<sub>sp</sub>:** The solution is saturated, and the system is at equilibrium.
* **Q > K<sub>sp</sub>:** The solution is supersaturated, and precipitation will occur until Q = K<sub>sp</sub>. [[Precipitation Reactions]]
