# [[Acids and Bases]]
# [[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs]]

A conjugate acid-base pair differs by a single proton ($H^+$).

* **Acid:**  A substance that donates a proton ($H^+$).
* **Base:** A substance that accepts a proton ($H^+$).

When an acid donates a proton, it forms its conjugate base.  When a base accepts a proton, it forms its conjugate acid.

## $$HA \rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$$

In this equation:

* $HA$ is the acid.
* $A^-$ is its conjugate base.

## $$B + H^+ \rightleftharpoons BH^+$$

In this equation:

* $B$ is the base.
* $BH^+$ is its conjugate acid.


**Examples:**

* $HCl$ (acid) and $Cl^-$ (conjugate base):  $HCl \rightleftharpoons H^+ + Cl^-$
* $NH_3$ (base) and $NH_4^+$ (conjugate acid): $NH_3 + H^+ \rightleftharpoons NH_4^+$
* $H_2O$ can act as both an acid and a base (amphoteric):
    * As an acid: $H_2O \rightleftharpoons H^+ + OH^-$  (conjugate base is $OH^-$)
    * As a base: $H_2O + H^+ \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+$ (conjugate acid is $H_3O^+$)
