## Entropy

Entropy (S) is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system.  The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time or remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state or undergoing a reversible process.  A system's entropy increases when it becomes more disordered (e.g., a gas expanding into a vacuum).  The change in entropy (ΔS) for a process is given by:

$$\Delta S = \frac{q_{rev}}{T}$$

where:

* ΔS = change in entropy
* q<sub>rev</sub> = heat transferred reversibly
* T = absolute [[Temperature]]
