# Entropy

Entropy (S) is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system.  It's a state function, and changes in entropy (ΔS) reflect changes in disorder.  A positive ΔS indicates an increase in disorder (more randomness), while a negative ΔS indicates a decrease in disorder (more order).  The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of the universe is always increasing for spontaneous processes.  Entropy is typically measured in J/mol·K.
