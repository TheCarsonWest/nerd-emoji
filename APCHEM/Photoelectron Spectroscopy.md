**Photoelectron Spectroscopy**
Photoelectron spectroscopy is a technique that measures the kinetic energy of electrons emitted from a material when it is irradiated with ultraviolet or X-ray radiation.
## How it works
1. **Irradiation:** A sample is irradiated with photons (UV or X-rays) with known energy.
2. **Photoionization:** The photons interact with electrons in the sample, causing them to be ejected (photoionization).
3. **Energy Analysis:** The kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is measured using an electron energy analyzer.
### Photoelectron spectroscopy provides information about the electronic structure of the material, including:
* **Element Identification:** By identifying the core-level binding energies of electrons, it can determine the elemental composition of the sample.

- A filled S/P/D/F shell will emit the same amount of energy every time
	- The peak will go up the same height
- If it is not filled, it will only go up part-way
- This one, for example, shows 3 full S shell peaks, meaning it is a $$1s^2  2s^2  2p^6  3s^2 3p^6  4s^2$$
