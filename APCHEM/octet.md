## Exceptions to the Octet Rule 
- Some only need 6
	- Al and B
- Some only need 2
	- H and He
- Some can have 12
	- 3rd period
	- $SF_6$, S has 12
	- $PCl_5$, P has 10
	- Pretty common actually
- Odd number of electrons
	- These shouldn't even exist really but other rules make it so they do ig
	- NO
	

Chatgpted drawn out explanation:

The octet rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a stable configuration with eight electrons in their valence shell. While a useful guideline, there are notable exceptions to this rule.

### 1. Incomplete Octet

* **Elements:**  Group 2 and 3 elements (Be, B, Al) often have fewer than eight electrons in their valence shell.
* **Explanation:**  These elements have a low electronegativity and readily form bonds by sharing electrons. However, they may not achieve a full octet due to their limited number of valence electrons.
* **Example:** Boron trifluoride ($BF_3$). Boron has only three valence electrons, forming three bonds with fluorine atoms. This leaves boron with only six electrons in its valence shell.

### 2. Expanded Octet

* **Elements:**  Elements in Period 3 and beyond (from P to the right) can accommodate more than eight electrons in their valence shell.
* **Explanation:**  These elements have available *d* orbitals in their valence shell, which can participate in bonding. This allows them to form more than four covalent bonds and expand their octet.
* **Example:** Sulfur hexafluoride ($SF_6$). Sulfur has six valence electrons and forms six bonds with fluorine atoms. This results in 12 electrons around sulfur, exceeding the octet rule.

### 3. Odd Number of Electrons

* **Elements:**  Elements with an odd number of valence electrons, such as nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$).
* **Explanation:**  These molecules cannot achieve an even number of electrons around each atom, making it impossible for all atoms to have a complete octet.
* **Example:** Nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$).  Nitrogen has five valence electrons, and oxygen has six.  The molecule has a total of 17 valence electrons, resulting in an odd number of electrons around each atom.

### 4. Transition Metal Ions

* **Elements:**  Transition metals often form ions with incomplete d-orbitals.
* **Explanation:**  The d-orbitals are involved in bonding and can hold up to ten electrons. However, transition metal ions often have fewer than eight electrons in their valence shell, particularly in complex ions.
* **Example:** Copper(II) ion ($Cu^{2+}$).  Copper has a d-orbital configuration of $3d^{10}$ in its neutral state.  When it loses two electrons to form $Cu^{2+}$, it has a $3d^9$ configuration. This configuration has only nine electrons in its valence shell.

### Summary

The octet rule is a useful simplification but doesn't always hold true. Understanding the exceptions to the octet rule is crucial for accurately predicting and explaining the behavior of molecules and ions.
