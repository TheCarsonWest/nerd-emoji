# [[[[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs]]]]
# [[Ka and Kb Relationships]]

**Main Idea:**  The relationship between $K_a$ (acid dissociation constant) and $K_b$ (base dissociation constant) for a conjugate acid-base pair is defined by the ion product constant of water, $K_w$.

**Key Equation:**

At 25°C, $K_w = K_a \times K_b = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}$

This equation holds true for a conjugate acid-base pair.  If you know the $K_a$ of an acid, you can calculate the $K_b$ of its conjugate base, and vice versa.

**Example:**

Find the $K_b$ for the conjugate base of hydrofluoric acid (HF), given that $K_a$ for HF is $7.2 \times 10^{-4}$.

$K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{7.2 \times 10^{-4}} = 1.4 \times 10^{-11}$


**Implications:**

* **Strong acids have weak conjugate bases:**  A strong acid has a very large $K_a$, meaning its conjugate base will have a very small $K_b$.
* **Weak acids have relatively stronger conjugate bases:** A weak acid has a small $K_a$, leading to a relatively larger $K_b$ for its conjugate base (though still less than 1).
* **pKa and pKb Relationship:**  Since $K_a \times K_b = K_w$, taking the negative logarithm of both sides gives:  $pK_a + pK_b = 14$ (at 25°C).
