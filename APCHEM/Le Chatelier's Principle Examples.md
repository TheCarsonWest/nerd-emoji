[[Le Chatelier's Principle]] states that if a change of condition is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system will shift in a direction that relieves the stress.  This can involve changes in concentration, pressure, volume, or temperature.

**Types of Stress and System Response:**

* **Change in Concentration:**
    * Increasing the concentration of a reactant shifts the equilibrium to the right (towards products).
    * Increasing the concentration of a product shifts the equilibrium to the left (towards reactants).
    * $K_{eq}$ remains unchanged (unless temperature changes).  Example:  $N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g)$  Adding more $N_2$ will shift the equilibrium to the right, producing more $NH_3$.

* **Change in Pressure/Volume:** (Applies only to gaseous reactions)
    * Increasing pressure (decreasing volume) favors the side with fewer moles of gas.
    * Decreasing pressure (increasing volume) favors the side with more moles of gas.
    * $K_{eq}$ remains unchanged (unless temperature changes). Example: $N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g)$. Increasing pressure shifts equilibrium to the right (fewer moles of gas on the product side).

* **Change in Temperature:**
    * **Exothermic reactions ($ΔH < 0$):** Increasing temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left (towards reactants), decreasing temperature shifts to the right.
    * **Endothermic reactions ($ΔH > 0$):** Increasing temperature shifts the equilibrium to the right (towards products), decreasing temperature shifts to the left.
    * $K_{eq}$ changes with temperature. [[[[Equilibrium]] Constant]]


**Examples:**

* **Haber Process ($N_2 + 3H_2 \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3 + heat$):**  This is an exothermic reaction. To maximize $NH_3$ production, high pressure, low temperature, and continuously removing $NH_3$ are employed.  However, low temperatures slow the reaction rate, hence a compromise is needed.

* **Dissolution of a slightly soluble salt:** $AgCl(s) \rightleftharpoons Ag^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)$ Adding $Cl^-$ ions will shift the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the solubility of $AgCl$. This is the common ion effect. [[Common Ion Effect]]

**Practice Problems:**

1. Predict the effect of increasing the pressure on the following equilibrium:  $2SO_2(g) + O_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2SO_3(g)$

2. Predict the effect of adding more $H_2$ to the following equilibrium: $H_2(g) + I_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2HI(g)$

3. Predict the effect of increasing the temperature on the following equilibrium:  $N_2(g) + O_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NO(g) \quad ΔH > 0$
