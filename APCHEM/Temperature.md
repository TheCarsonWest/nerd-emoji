# Temperature

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  It's an intensive property, meaning it doesn't depend on the amount of substance.  Higher temperature indicates faster particle motion. Temperature is measured in Celsius (°C), Kelvin (K), or Fahrenheit (°F).  The Kelvin scale is the absolute temperature scale, where 0 K represents absolute zero (no particle motion).  Conversions between scales are crucial:

* **K = °C + 273.15**
* **°F = (9/5)°C + 32**
