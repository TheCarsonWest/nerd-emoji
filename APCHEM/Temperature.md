## [[Temperature]]

[[Temperature]] is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  It's a measure of how hot or cold something is.  [[Temperature]] is usually measured in Celsius (°C), Kelvin (K), or Fahrenheit (°F).  The Kelvin scale is the absolute temperature scale, where 0 K represents absolute zero – the theoretical point at which all molecular motion ceases.  The conversion between Celsius and Kelvin is:

$$K = °C + 273.15$$
