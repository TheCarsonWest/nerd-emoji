## [[Chemical Bonds]]
• **[[Alloys]]** are metallic, homogeneous mixtures composed of two or more elements.
• These mixtures include both **pure metals** and **alloys**.
• **Pure metals** serve as the baseline for understanding metal properties (e.g., malleability, conductivity).

## **Types of [[Alloys]]:**

### **Substitutional [[Alloys]]:**

• In these alloys, some of the atoms of the base metal are replaced by atoms of a different element that have a similar size.
• Example: **Brass** (Copper and Zinc) and **Bronze** (Copper and Tin) are common substitutional alloys.
• These alloys are generally malleable and maintain properties such as lower electrical conductivity than pure metals.
• They have similar densities to the base metal, offering a blend of properties between the elements involved.

###  **Interstitial [[Alloys]]:**
• Occurs when smaller atoms fit into the spaces (interstices) between the larger atoms in a crystal lattice.
• Example: **Steel**, where small carbon atoms fit into the interstices of iron’s crystal lattice.
• These alloys are harder and less malleable than substitutional alloys.
• Due to the restricted movement of atoms, interstitial alloys tend to have **higher melting points**.
• The hardness and strength come from the atoms’ interference with each other, making bending more difficult.

### **Combination of Substitutional and Interstitial [[Alloys]]:**

• Example: **Stainless Steel**, a hybrid alloy, where **chromium** substitutes some of the **iron** atoms (substitutional), and **carbon** atoms occupy interstitial spaces.
• Stainless steel exhibits both the hardness and toughness of interstitial alloys and the corrosion resistance and sheen from chromium substitution.


## Properties

• **Substitutional [[Alloys]]** (e.g., brass and bronze):
	- Tend to be **malleable** (easy to shape).
	• Lower **electrical conductivity** compared to pure metals.
	• **Density** is similar to the pure metal from which they are derived.
• **Interstitial [[Alloys]]** (e.g., steel):
	• Generally **harder** and **less malleable** due to atoms interfering with each other’s movements.
	• Have a **higher melting point** due to restricted atomic movement.
• **Combination [[Alloys]]** (e.g., stainless steel):
	• Exhibit unique properties like **corrosion resistance**, **shine**, and **hardness**.


These three types of alloys highlight how combining different elements can drastically alter the properties of metals to make them suitable for various industrial and practical applications.
