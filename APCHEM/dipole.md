### Dipoles are covalent bonds with a high polarity
### used in [[intermolecular forces]]

### Dipole Moment formula
### More moment = more polar
# $$ µ = Qr $$
- µ: Strength
- Q: Quantity of charge(magnitude of charges)
- R: distance
basically a high dipole strength is a result of the atoms pulling each other in and having a lot of charge. Just look at [[Electronegativity]] it gives the same info
