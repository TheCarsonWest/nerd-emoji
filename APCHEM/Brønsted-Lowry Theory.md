# [[Acids and Bases]]
# [[Brønsted-Lowry Theory]]

The Brønsted-Lowry theory defines acids and bases based on the transfer of protons ($H^+$).

* **Acid:** A species that donates a proton.
* **Base:** A species that accepts a proton.

**Key Concepts:**

* **[[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs]]:**  An acid and its conjugate base differ by a single proton.  Similarly, a base and its conjugate acid differ by a single proton.  For example, in the reaction of $HCl$ with $H_2O$:

   $HCl(aq) + H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)$

   $HCl$ is the acid, $Cl^-$ is its conjugate base, $H_2O$ is the base, and $H_3O^+$ is its conjugate acid.

* **[[Amphoteric Substances]]:**  Substances that can act as both acids and bases.  Water is a classic example:

   $H_2O(l) + H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$

   In this autoionization of water, one water molecule acts as an acid (donating a proton), and the other acts as a base (accepting a proton).

* **Strong vs. Weak Acids/Bases:** This relates to the extent of proton donation/acceptance. Strong acids/bases completely dissociate in water, while weak acids/bases only partially dissociate.  [[Acid and Base Strength]]

* **$K_a$ and $K_b$:** The acid dissociation constant ($K_a$) and base dissociation constant ($K_b$) quantify the strength of weak acids and bases, respectively.  A larger $K_a$ or $K_b$ indicates a stronger acid or base. [[Equilibrium Constants]]

* **pH and pOH:**  These scales measure the acidity and basicity of a solution, respectively. They are related to the concentration of $H_3O^+$ and $OH^-$ ions.  $pH = -\log_{10}[H_3O^+]$ and $pOH = -\log_{10}[OH^-]$. At 25°C, $pH + pOH = 14$. [[pH and pOH Calculations]]

* **Titrations:**  Titrations are used to determine the concentration of an unknown acid or base by reacting it with a solution of known concentration. [[Acid-Base Titrations]]


**Example Reaction:**

The reaction between ammonia ($NH_3$) and water:

## $$NH_3(aq) + H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons NH_4^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$$

In this reaction, $NH_3$ acts as a base (accepting a proton from water), and $H_2O$ acts as an acid (donating a proton). $NH_4^+$ is the conjugate acid of $NH_3$, and $OH^-$ is the conjugate base of $H_2O$.
