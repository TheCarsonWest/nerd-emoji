Pi bonds are a type of covalent bond formed by the **sideways overlap of atomic orbitals**.  Unlike sigma bonds, which are formed by the direct overlap of orbitals along the internuclear axis, pi bonds occur above and below the plane of the sigma bond. 

**Formation:**

Pi bonds are formed when two **p orbitals** on adjacent atoms align parallel to each other. This alignment allows for electron density to be concentrated above and below the plane of the sigma bond.
