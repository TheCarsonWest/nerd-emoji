# how to figure out the polarity of a molecule in 5 easy steps
1. Is it an Ionic Compounds?
	- If yes, yes its polar
2. Is it Metallic?
	- If yes, then you are worried about the wrong thing right now my guy
3. Is it Covalent?
	- If you made it this far its obviously covalent
		4. Look at a diagram of the molecule
			5.  Is there both an outward-facing negative and outward-facing positive charge?
			- If you don't have the charges already labelled, figure it out by finding the [[Electronegativity]] of each atom, and seeing where the electrons pull towards
				- If yes, then yes
				- If no, then no
# How to figure out how polar a polar molecule is
## Get the [[delta]] of the [[Electronegativity]]s of your outward-facing positive and your outward-facing negative atoms(only one)
- Big number = more polar
- Small number = not very polar
Theres also [[dipole|Dipole Moments]] but it literally gives the same information but is more complicated
