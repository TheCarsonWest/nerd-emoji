# Absolute Entropy and Entropy Change: An AP Chemistry Rundown

## What is Entropy?

Entropy ($S$) is a thermodynamic state function that describes the degree of randomness or disorder in a system.  A system with high entropy is highly disordered, while a system with low entropy is highly ordered.  The units of entropy are J/mol·K (joules per mole-kelvin).

## Absolute Entropy ($S^\circ$)

Unlike other thermodynamic state functions like enthalpy ($\Delta H$), entropy has an absolute zero point.  This means we can assign an absolute entropy value ($S^\circ$) to substances at a specific temperature (usually 298 K, 25°C, and 1 atm).  These values are experimentally determined and tabulated.  The third law of thermodynamics provides the basis for this:  the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero (0 K) is zero.  

**Key characteristics of Absolute Entropy:**

* **Always positive:** $S^\circ$ values are always positive because entropy increases from zero at absolute zero.
* **Temperature dependent:** $S^\circ$ increases with increasing temperature.
* **State dependent:** $S^\circ$ depends on the physical state (solid, liquid, gas) and allotropic form of the substance. Gases have much higher $S^\circ$ values than liquids, which have higher $S^\circ$ values than solids.
* **Increases with complexity:**  More complex molecules generally have higher $S^\circ$ values than simpler molecules.


## Entropy Change ($\Delta S$)

The entropy change ($\Delta S$) represents the change in disorder during a process.  It's calculated as the difference between the final and initial entropies:

$ \Delta S = S_{final} - S_{initial} $

For a chemical reaction at standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm), the standard entropy change ($\Delta S^\circ$) is given by:

$ \Delta S^\circ_{rxn} = \sum nS^\circ_{products} - \sum mS^\circ_{reactants} $

where *n* and *m* are the stoichiometric coefficients of the products and reactants, respectively, and $S^\circ$ represents the standard molar entropy of each substance.

## Predicting the Sign of $\Delta S$

We can often predict the sign of $\Delta S$ for a process based on the changes in state, number of molecules, and volume:

* **Phase transitions:** $\Delta S$ is positive for processes that increase disorder, such as melting ($S_{liquid} > S_{solid}$) and boiling ($S_{gas} > S_{liquid}$).  $\Delta S$ is negative for processes that decrease disorder, such as freezing and condensation.

* **Changes in the number of gas molecules:**  If the number of gas molecules increases during a reaction, $\Delta S$ is positive (more disorder). If the number of gas molecules decreases, $\Delta S$ is negative (less disorder).

* **Dissolution:** Dissolving a solid or liquid in a solvent usually leads to a positive $\Delta S$, as the solute particles become more dispersed.  However, this isn't always the case.

* **Reactions involving gases and solids/liquids:** Reactions that produce more moles of gas will generally have a positive $\Delta S$, while those that consume gas will have a negative $\Delta S$.


## Gibbs Free Energy and Entropy

Entropy is crucial in determining the spontaneity of a reaction.  It is incorporated into the Gibbs free energy equation:

$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$

where $\Delta G$ is the change in Gibbs free energy, $\Delta H$ is the change in enthalpy, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy.  A negative $\Delta G$ indicates a spontaneous process.  The contribution of entropy to spontaneity becomes more significant at higher temperatures.
