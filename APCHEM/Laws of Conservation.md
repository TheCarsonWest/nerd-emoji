## Laws of Conservation

The laws of thermodynamics govern energy changes in chemical and physical processes.  They are:

* **First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Conservation of Energy):** Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or changed from one form to another.  The total energy of the universe remains constant.  This is expressed mathematically as ΔE = q + w, where ΔE is the change in internal energy, q is heat, and w is work.

* **Second Law of Thermodynamics:** The total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time, or remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state or undergoing a reversible process.

* **Third Law of Thermodynamics:** The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero (0 K) is zero.
