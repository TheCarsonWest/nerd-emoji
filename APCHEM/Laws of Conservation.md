# Laws of Conservation

Several laws govern thermodynamic processes:

* **First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Conservation of Energy):**  Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another.  This is reflected in the equation ΔU = q + w, where ΔU is the change in internal energy, q is heat, and w is work.

* **Second Law of Thermodynamics:** The total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time or remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state or undergoing a reversible process.

* **Third Law of Thermodynamics:** The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is zero.
