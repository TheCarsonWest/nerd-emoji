[[Chemical Bonds]]
# Uses little delta δ symbol

## Atoms in molecules have partial charges because electrons are goofy 

# $$Na^{δ+}\ \ \textemdash\ \ \ Cl^{δ-}$$
- High [[Polarity]] molecules will have high intermolecular attraction 
	-  Things will attract each other a certain amount based on [[Electronegativity]]
	- **All Ionic Compounds are polar** because all the positive sides of ionic molecules have low electronegativity
	- Covalent Compounds get polarity based on the [[delta]] of their electronegativity
	- See [[Polarity]]
# [[Dipole Dipole]]: Opposites attract
# [[London Dispersion]]: Dipoles randomly form because an electron randomly stepped out of place
# [[Hydrogen Bonds]]: Dipole Dipole but with hydrogen
