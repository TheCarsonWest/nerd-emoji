[[Chemical Bonds]]
# Uses little delta δ symbol(different than [[delta]])

## Atoms in molecules have partial charges because electrons are goofy 
## IMFS are never as strong as [[chemical bonds]]
# $$Na^{δ+}\ \ \textemdash\ \ \ Cl^{δ-}$$
- High [[Polarity]] molecules will have high intermolecular attraction 
	-  Things will attract each other a certain amount based on [[Electronegativity]]
	- **All Ionic Compounds are polar** because all the positive sides of ionic molecules have low [[electronegativity]]
	- Covalent Compounds get [[polarity]] based on the [[delta]] of their [[electronegativity]]
	- See [[Polarity]]


# Van Der Waals IMFs
van der waals is a fancy way of saying these are the ones that exist between **identical molecules**
## Dipole Dipole: Opposites attract
- Only occurs in polar molecules
- HBr is a highly polar molecule, and the Br will be attracted to other molecules' hydrogens
## [[London Dispersion]]
## Hydrogen Bonds: Dipole Dipole but with hydrogen
- Only occurs in molecules with:
	- A Highly electronegative([[Electronegativity]]) Element
		- O N or F
	- Hydrogen
- $H_2O$ has a Oxygen, a very electronegative element, and hydrogen. The oxygen will attract the other molecules hydrogen

# Non Van Der Waals IMFs
## Ion Dipole: An ion attracts a [[dipole]]

# What IMFs do
## Kinetic energy
- More IMF means less movement
- **Things with strong IMFs will typically have a higher boiling point**
	- Gases: least IMF
- The existence of IMF creates the states of matter solids and liquid
## Boiling point
- More IMF = more boiling
- Weak attractions increases non-agitated evaporation
	- A cup of water left open in a dark room at room temperature will fully evaporate in 5 days
	- A glass of isopropyl will evaporate in the same conditions in 2 days
