### High Pressure and low temperature screws [[ideal gas laws]] up
- This is because the **size of the atoms starts becoming signficant and they begin bouncing into each other**
- When gasses are compressed to high pressures, the volume created from their atoms is actually important, since they occupy a noticeable amount of space
- because of this, you need to subtract the volume of the gasses.
### Once gas has a noticeable volume because of pressure,  the atoms start attracting to each other
- Rain!
### Once the atoms start attracting each other, they start hitting the walls with way less force(because the other atoms are slowing them down)
- Since the ideal gasses don't attract each other, they give off much more pressure
- You need to correct this by adding back to the pressure
# [[Van der Waals Gas Equation]]
# $$\left[ P+\frac{an^2}{V^2}\right]]\left[V-nb\right]]=nRT$$
