## More polarizability = more london dispersion = more clumping = higher bp

Polarizability refers to ==a molecule's tendency to develop a [[dipole]] moment when exposed to an electric field==, essentially meaning how easily its electron cloud can be distorted by an external electric field; the greater the polarizability, the more readily the electron cloud can be displaced, creating a temporary [[dipole]] moment. 

Key points about polarizability:

- **Concept:**
    When an electric field is applied, the negatively charged electrons in a molecule are pulled in one direction while the positively charged nucleus is pulled in the opposite direction, leading to a temporary separation of charge and creating a [[dipole]] moment. 

- **Factors affecting polarizability:**
    - **Electron cloud size:** Larger electron clouds are more easily distorted, resulting in higher polarizability. 
    - **[[Atomic Radius]]:** Larger atoms generally have higher polarizability due to their larger electron clouds. 
    - **Molecular shape:** Elongated molecules tend to be more polarizable than spherical ones.
