**Key Concepts:**

* **Dynamic [[Equilibrium]]:**  A state where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, resulting in no net change in concentrations of reactants and products.  $Rate_{forward} = Rate_{reverse}$

* **[[Equilibrium]] Constant ($K$):**  A quantitative measure of the relative amounts of reactants and products at equilibrium.  For the generic reaction: $aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD$, the equilibrium constant expression is:

 ## $$K = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$

* **$K_c$ vs $K_p$**: $K_c$ uses molar concentrations, while $K_p$ uses partial pressures (for gaseous reactions).  The relationship between them is given by:

 ## $$K_p = K_c(RT)^{\Delta n}$$

 where $\Delta n$ is the change in the number of moles of gas (moles of gaseous products - moles of gaseous reactants), $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

* **Reaction Quotient ($Q$):** Similar to $K$, but uses concentrations at any point in the reaction, not just at equilibrium.  Comparing $Q$ to $K$ predicts the direction the reaction will shift to reach equilibrium:
    * $Q < K$: Reaction shifts right (towards products)
    * $Q > K$: Reaction shifts left (towards reactants)
    * $Q = K$: Reaction is at equilibrium


* **[[Le Chateliers Principle]]:**  If a change of condition is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system will shift in a direction that relieves the stress.  Stresses include:
    * **Changes in concentration:** Adding reactant shifts right, adding product shifts left.
    * **Changes in pressure/volume:** Increasing pressure (decreasing volume) favors the side with fewer moles of gas.  Decreasing pressure (increasing volume) favors the side with more moles of gas.
    * **Changes in temperature:**  
        * **Exothermic reactions ($ \Delta H < 0$):** Increasing temperature shifts left, decreasing temperature shifts right.
        * **Endothermic reactions ($ \Delta H > 0$):** Increasing temperature shifts right, decreasing temperature shifts left.


* **Calculating [[Equilibrium Concentrations]]:  Often involves setting up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium]]) table and solving for unknown concentrations using the equilibrium constant expression.
