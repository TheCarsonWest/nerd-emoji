# [[AP CHEM solutions]]
# [[Solubility Rules]]

Solubility refers to the ability of a substance (the solute) to dissolve in another substance (the solvent) to form a homogeneous mixture called a solution.  In AP Calculus AB, while we don't directly calculate solubility itself, we can use calculus concepts to analyze related topics like rates of dissolution or changes in concentration over time.

## Factors Affecting Solubility

Several factors influence solubility, including:

* **Nature of the Solute and Solvent:**  [[Polarity]] and [[Intermolecular Forces]] play a crucial role. "Like dissolves like."
* **[[Temperature]]:**  Generally, the solubility of solids in liquids increases with temperature, while the solubility of gases in liquids decreases with [[Temperature]].
* **Pressure:**  Pressure primarily affects the solubility of gases in liquids.  [[Henrys Law]] describes this relationship.
* **Presence of Other Substances:**  The presence of common ions can affect solubility through the [[Common Ion Effect]].


## Rate of Dissolution

The rate at which a solute dissolves can be analyzed using calculus. While a simplified model might involve a constant rate, more realistic scenarios involve rates that change over time.  For instance, the rate might be proportional to the difference between the saturation concentration and the current concentration.

Suppose $C(t)$ represents the concentration of the solute at time $t$, and $C_s$ is the saturation concentration. A possible model for the rate of dissolution could be:

# $$\frac{dC}{dt} = k(C_s - C(t))$$

where $k$ is a rate constant.  This is a [[Derivative]] equation that can be solved using separation of variables to determine $C(t)$.


## Concentration over Time

Solving the differential equation above allows us to determine how the concentration of the solute changes over time.  The solution often takes the form of an exponential function approaching the saturation concentration.

## [[Saturation]]

Saturation occurs when the maximum amount of solute has dissolved in a solvent at a given temperature and pressure. At this point, a dynamic equilibrium exists between dissolved and undissolved solute.


## Supersaturation

Supersaturation is a state where the concentration of a solute exceeds its equilibrium solubility. This is a metastable state, and the excess solute can readily precipitate out of the solution if disturbed.


## Calculus Applications in Related Topics

While not directly related to solubility calculations, calculus concepts are crucial for understanding related topics like:

* **Chemical Kinetics:**  [[Reaction Rates]] and [[Rate Laws]] often involve differential equations.
* **Equilibrium:**  Changes in equilibrium concentrations can be analyzed using calculus.
* **[[Titration]] Curves:**  The inflection point of a [[titration]] curve can be determined using derivatives.
