# [[AP CHEM solutions]]
Several methods can express the concentration of a solute in a solution.  Here are some of the most common:

* **[[Molarity]] (M):**  Moles of solute per liter of solution.

    $M = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}$

* **Molality (m):** Moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.

    $m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kilograms of solvent}}$

* **Mass Percent (%):** Mass of solute divided by the total mass of the solution, multiplied by 100%.

    $\%\text{ mass} = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \times 100\%$

* **Mole Fraction ($\chi$):** Moles of a component divided by the total moles of all components in the solution.

    $\chi_A = \frac{\text{moles of A}}{\text{total moles}}$

* **Parts Per Million (ppm) and Parts Per Billion (ppb):**  Used for very dilute solutions.

    $\text{ppm} = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \times 10^6$

    $\text{ppb} = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \times 10^9$
