# [[AP CHEM solutions]]

Gas [[solubility]] refers to the ability of a gas to dissolve in a liquid.  Unlike solids and liquids, the [[solubility]] of gases is significantly affected by pressure and [[Temperature]]. Understanding these factors is crucial for predicting and explaining gas behavior in various systems.

##  Calculating [[Gas Solubility]] 
Using [[Henrys Law]], we can calculate the concentration of a dissolved gas given its [[partial pressure]] and [[Henrys Law]] constant.  For example, if the [[partial pressure]] of $CO_2$ above a soda is 2 atm and $k_H$ for $CO_2$ in water at a given [[Temperature]] is 0.034 mol/L·atm, the concentration of dissolved $CO_2$ would be:

$C = k_H P = (0.034 \text{ mol/L·atm}) (2 \text{ atm}) = 0.068 \text{ mol/L}$


This calculation provides a simplified model.  In reality, deviations from [[Henrys Law]] can occur at higher pressures or when the gas is highly soluble.
## Factors Affecting [[Gas Solubility]] 
### 1. Pressure: [[Henrys Law]]

### 2. Temperature
Generally, the [[Solubility]] of gases in liquids *decreases* with increasing [[Temperature]].  As [[Temperature]] rises, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, allowing them to overcome the [[intermolecular forces]] holding them in solution and escape into the gaseous phase.  This is why a warm soda goes flat faster than a cold one.
### 3. Nature of the Gas and Solvent
The chemical nature of both the gas and the solvent plays a role in [[Solubility]].  Polar gases tend to dissolve better in polar solvents (like water), while nonpolar gases dissolve better in nonpolar solvents (like hydrocarbons).  This is due to the principle of "like dissolves like," where similar [[intermolecular forces]] between solute and solvent facilitate dissolution.  For instance, $CO_2$ (a slightly polar molecule) is more soluble in water than $O_2$ (a nonpolar molecule).

### 4.  Presence of Other Solutes

The presence of other dissolved substances in the solvent can affect the [[solubility]] of a gas.  These interactions can either enhance or hinder the gas's [[Solubility]], depending on the specific solute-solute and solute-solvent interactions.
