[[APCHEM Gasses]]

#### The gas constant is a constant, represented by R, that is used in the [[Ideal Gas Laws]] equations
# For equations using Kilopascals(kPa): $$ R = 8.314 \text{ kPa L mol}^{-[[1}\text{ K}^{-[[1}$$
# For equations using Atmospheres(atm):
# $$ R = 0.08206 \text{ atm L mol}^{-[[1}\text{ K}^{-[[1}$$
