# [[Equilibrium Constant Calculations]]

This section covers calculations involving equilibrium constants ($K$).  We'll break it down by type of equilibrium.

**1. $K_c$ ([[Equilibrium]] Constant in terms of concentration):**

*   **Definition:** $K_c = \frac{[Products]}{[Reactants]}$  where the bracketed terms represent the equilibrium concentrations raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients.
*   **Example:** For the reaction $aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD$,  $K_c = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$
*   **[[ICE Tables:**  Use ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium]]) tables to organize information and solve for equilibrium concentrations when some are known.  (ICE Table Examples]]]])
*   **Calculations:** Often involve solving quadratic or cubic equations.  Approximations can be made if $K$ is very small or very large. ([[Approximation Techniques]])
*   **Units:** $K_c$ has units that depend on the stoichiometry of the reaction.  Usually omitted for simplicity.

**2. $K_p$ ([[Equilibrium]] Constant in terms of partial pressures):**

*   **Definition:**  Similar to $K_c$, but uses partial pressures of gases instead of concentrations. $K_p = \frac{P_{products}}{P_{reactants}}$
*   **Relationship to $K_c$:** $K_p = K_c(RT)^{\Delta n}$, where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and $\Delta n$ is the change in the number of moles of gas (moles of gaseous products - moles of gaseous reactants). [[K_p and K_c Relationship]]
*   **Calculations:**  Similar to $K_c$ calculations, but using partial pressures.


**3.  $K_w$ (Ion-Product Constant for Water):**

*   **Definition:** $K_w = [H_3O^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}$ at 25°C.  ([[Water Autoionization]])
*   **pH and pOH:** Related to $K_w$ by: $pH + pOH = 14$ at 25°C.  ([[pH and pOH Calculations]])


**4. Heterogeneous Equilibria:**

*   **Definition:** Equilibria involving reactants and products in different phases (e.g., solids, liquids, gases).
*   **$K$ expression:** Pure solids and liquids are excluded from the $K$ expression because their concentrations are essentially constant. [[Heterogeneous Equilibria Examples]]


**5. Calculating [[Equilibrium]] Concentrations:**

*   Often requires solving equilibrium expressions which can range from simple algebraic equations to more complex systems requiring numerical methods. [[Solving Equilibrium Expressions]]
