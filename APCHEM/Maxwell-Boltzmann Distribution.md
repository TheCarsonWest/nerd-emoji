# [[chemical reactions]]
The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of molecular speeds in a sample of gas at a given [[Temperature]].  It shows the probability of finding a molecule with a particular speed.

## Key Features

* **Shape:** The distribution is asymmetrical.  It starts at zero (no molecules have zero speed), rises to a peak, and then gradually tails off at higher speeds.  The exact shape depends on the [[Temperature]] and the molar mass of the gas. [[Temperature Dependence]] [[Molar Mass Dependence]]
* **Most Probable Speed (v<sub>p</sub>):** The speed at the peak of the curve represents the most probable speed â€“ the speed that the largest number of molecules possess.
* **Average Speed (v<sub>avg</sub>):** The average speed of all the molecules in the sample.  It is slightly higher than the most probable speed. [[Average Speed Calculation]]
* **Root-Mean-Square Speed (v<sub>rms</sub>):** The square root of the average of the squares of the speeds. This value is related to the average kinetic energy of the gas particles. It is the highest of the three characteristic speeds. [[Root-Mean-Square Speed Calculation]]

The x-axis represents molecular speed, and the y-axis represents the number of molecules with that speed.  The different curves illustrate the effect of temperature on the distribution.

## Mathematical Representation

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function, which gives the probability density for a molecule having a speed *v*, is given by:

# $$f(v) = 4\pi (\frac{m}{2\pi kT})^{\frac{3}{2}} v^2 e^{-\frac{mv^2}{2kT}}$$


Where:

* *f(v)* is the probability density function
* *v* is the speed of the molecule
* *m* is the mass of a single molecule
* *k* is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10<sup>-23</sup> [[J]]/K)
* *T* is the absolute [[Temperature]] in Kelvin

## Implications

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution has several important implications in chemistry:

* **[[Reaction Rates]]:**  The distribution shows that at any given [[Temperature]], a fraction of the molecules possesses sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the [[Activation Energy]] barrier for a chemical reaction. [[Activation Energy]] [[Collision Theory]]
* **Diffusion and Effusion:** The distribution explains the rates of diffusion and effusion of gases. [[Graham's Law]]
* **Gas Behavior:**  The distribution underlies the kinetic molecular theory of gases and helps explain macroscopic properties like pressure and [[Temperature]].
