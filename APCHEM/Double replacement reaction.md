### [[Reactions Types]]
Double replacement reactions, also known as metathesis reactions, are [[chemical reactions]] in which the cations and anions of two ionic compounds exchange places to form two new ionic compounds. The general equation for a double replacement reaction is:

$$
AB + CD → AD + CB
$$

where A and C are cations and B and D are anions.

### **Conditions for Double Replacement [[Reactions Types]]**

Double replacement reactions occur when:

* One of the reactants is a strong acid or base.
* Both reactants are soluble in water.
* The products are insoluble in water (precipitation reaction).
* The products are gases.

### **Types of Double Replacement [[Reactions Types]]**

There are three main types of double replacement reactions:

* **Precipitation reactions:** These reactions produce an insoluble solid precipitate.
* **Gas-evolution reactions:** These reactions produce a gas as one of the products.
- ### **Acid-base reactions:** These reactions produce water and a salt. VVVV
## Neutralization
# $$ Acid+Base → H_2O + Salt $$


- Acid and Base will **neutralize** each other to a pH of 7, if perfectly balanced
- Used in [[Titration]] to find the [[molarity]] of one of the reactants

### **Example of a Double Replacement Reaction**

The reaction between sodium chloride ($NaCl$) and silver nitrate ($AgNO_3$) is a double replacement reaction that produces a precipitate of silver chloride ($AgCl$):

 $$ NaCl_{_{(aq)}} + AgNO_{3_{(aq)}} → AgCl_{_{(s)}} + NaNO_{3_{(aq)}} $$
