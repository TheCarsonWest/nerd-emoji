# [[Equilibrium Constant Calculations]]]]
# [[Heterogeneous Equilibria Examples]]

Heterogeneous equilibria involve reactants and products in different phases.  The concentration of pure solids and liquids are essentially constant and therefore are omitted from the equilibrium expression.

**Key Idea:** Only gaseous and aqueous species appear in the equilibrium constant expression, $K$.

**Examples:**

* **Dissolution of a slightly soluble salt:**

   Consider the dissolution of silver chloride ($AgCl$) in water:

   $AgCl(s) \rightleftharpoons Ag^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)$

   The equilibrium constant expression is:  $K_{sp} = [Ag^+][Cl^-]$  ($K_{sp}$ is the solubility product constant).  Note that solid $AgCl$ is omitted. [[Solubility Product Constant]]

* **Decomposition of a solid:**

   Consider the decomposition of calcium carbonate ($CaCO_3$):

   $CaCO_3(s) \rightleftharpoons CaO(s) + CO_2(g)$

   The equilibrium constant expression is: $K_p = P_{CO_2}$ where $P_{CO_2}$ is the partial pressure of $CO_2$.  Both $CaCO_3(s)$ and $CaO(s)$ are omitted.

* **Reactions involving gases and solids:**

   Consider the reaction between carbon monoxide and iron(III) oxide:

   $3CO(g) + Fe_2O_3(s) \rightleftharpoons 2Fe(s) + 3CO_2(g)$

   The equilibrium constant expression is: $K = \frac{P_{CO_2}^3}{P_{CO}^3}$


* **Reactions with water:**

    The equilibrium between gaseous carbon dioxide and aqueous carbonic acid:
    $$CO_2(g) + H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons H_2CO_3(aq)$$
    The equilibrium expression would be:  $K = \frac{[H_2CO_3]}{P_{CO_2}}$.  Liquid water is omitted. [[Acid-Base Equilibria]]


**General Considerations:**

*  The equilibrium constant, $K$, is temperature dependent.  A change in temperature will shift the equilibrium. [[Le Chateliers Principle]]
*  Adding more solid or liquid reactant or product will not affect the equilibrium position, since their concentrations are constant.
*  Changes in pressure only affect the equilibrium if gases are involved.  Increasing pressure will favor the side with fewer gas molecules. [[Gas Laws]]
