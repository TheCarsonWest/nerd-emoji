# These first two things aren't written down in everyday writing
# Fat-ha, Dama, Kasra 
they are short vowels
I already know this so im going to skip over it
- Fat-ha: Short alif ا
- Dama: Short waaw و
- Kasra: Short yaa ي

# Shadda and sukun
 - Sukun, shaped like a sun
	 - Makes you pronounce two consonant together, no short vowel in between
 - Shadda
	 - Doubles the sound of a consonant
	 - The word شادة without a shadda would just be "shadda"
	 - If we add a shadda, making it شادّة, it is pronounced "Shad-da"
