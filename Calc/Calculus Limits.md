# [[Calc home]]
Limits are a fundamental concept in calculus that describe the behavior of a function as its input approaches a certain value. They are essential for understanding [[Continuity]], derivatives, and [[integrals]].

### Definition of a Limit

The limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$, denoted by  
## $$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$$  
means that the value of $f(x)$ gets arbitrarily close to $L$ as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $a$, without necessarily being equal to $a$.

### Types of Limits
There are different types of limits depending on how $x$ approaches $a$:
* **One-sided limits:**
    * **Right-hand limit:** $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$  represents the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from values greater than $a$.
    * **Left-hand limit:** $\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$ represents the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from values less than $a$.
* **Two-sided limit:** $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists if and only if both the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit exist and are equal.

### Evaluating Limits

There are several techniques for evaluating limits:

* **Direct substitution:** If the function is continuous at $a$, we can simply substitute $a$ into the function.
* **Factoring and simplifying:**  We can factor the expression and cancel common factors to simplify the function.
* **Rationalizing:** If the function involves radicals, we can rationalize the numerator or denominator.
* **[[LHopitals Rule]]:** This rule applies when the limit results in an indeterminate form (such as $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$).

### [[Limits at Infinity]]

Limits at infinity describe the behavior of a function as its input approaches positive or negative infinity.

* **Horizontal asymptotes:** If $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L$ or $\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = L$, then the line $y = L$ is a horizontal asymptote of the graph of $f(x)$.

### [[Continuity]]

A function is continuous at a point $a$ if the following conditions hold:

1. $f(a)$ is defined.
2. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists.
3. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$.

### [[Intermediate Value Theorem]]

The [[Intermediate Value Theorem]] states that if a function $f(x)$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]]$ and $k$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists at least one number $c$ in the interval $[a, b]]$ such that $f(c) = k$.

### Applications of Limits

Limits have numerous applications in calculus and other areas of mathematics, including:

* **[[Derivative]]:** The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient.
* **[[integrals]]:** The definite integral of a function over an interval is defined as the limit of a Riemann sum.
* **[[Continuity]]:** Limits are used to define and understand [[Continuity]], which is a fundamental concept in calculus and analysis.
* **Optimization:** Limits can be used to find the maximum or minimum values of a function.
* **Approximation:** Limits can be used to approximate the value of a function at a point or the area under a curve.

### Conclusion

Limits are a fundamental concept in calculus that play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of functions and their applications. By understanding limits, we can gain a deeper understanding of [[Continuity]], derivatives, [[integrals]], and other important concepts in calculus.
