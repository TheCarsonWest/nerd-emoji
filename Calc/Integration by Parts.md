## [[Integration by Parts]] 
This technique is used when the integrand is a product of two functions.  It's based on the product rule for differentiation.

**Formula:** $\int u dv = uv - \int v du$

**Choosing u and dv:**  The choice of $u$ and $dv$ is crucial and often involves using the "LIATE" rule (Logarithmic, Inverse Trigonometric, Algebraic, Trigonometric, Exponential).  Prioritize choosing $u$ according to this order.

**Example:** $\int x e^x dx$

Let $u = x$, $dv = e^x dx$. Then $du = dx$, $v = e^x$.

$\int x e^x dx = xe^x - \int e^x dx = xe^x - e^x + C$
