The derivative of a function measures the instantaneous rate of change of the function.  It is a fundamental concept in calculus and has applications in many fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and biology.

### Definition
The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x=a$, denoted by $f'(a)$, is defined as the limit:

$$f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$$
provided the limit exists.
### Interpretation of the [[Derivative]]

* **Slope of the Tangent Line:**  The derivative $f'(a)$ represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f(x)$ at the point $(a, f(a))$.

* **Instantaneous Rate of Change:** The derivative $f'(a)$ represents the instantaneous rate of change of $f(x)$ at $x=a$.

### Applications of Derivatives

Derivatives have numerous applications in calculus and beyond. Some key applications include:
* **Finding Critical Points:** Critical points are points where the derivative is zero or undefined. These points can indicate local maxima, minima, or points of inflection.
* **Optimization:** Derivatives can be used to find the maximum or minimum values of a function.
* **Related Rates:** Derivatives can be used to find the rate of change of one variable with respect to another.
* **[[Local Linearity]]:** The derivative can be used to approximate the value of a function near a given point.

## [[Higher Order Derivatives]]

The derivative of a function can be differentiated again to find the second derivative, denoted by $f''(x)$.  This process can be repeated to find the third derivative, fourth derivative, and so on.  [[Higher order derivatives]] are used to study the concavity of a function and its points of inflection.

## [[Implicit Differentiation]]

[[Implicit differentiation]] is a technique used to find the derivative of a function that is defined implicitly by an equation.  For example, the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ defines a circle. To find the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$, we differentiate both sides of the equation implicitly.

## [[Trigonometric Derivatives]]

### Examples

* **Example 1:** Find the derivative of $f(x) = x^3 + 2x$.

   Using the [[power rule]] and the sum rule, we get:

   $$f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2$$

* **Example 2:** Find the derivative of $g(x) = \sin(x^2)$.
   Using the [[chain rule]], we get:
   $$g'(x) = \cos(x^2) \cdot 2x = 2x \cos(x^2)$$
