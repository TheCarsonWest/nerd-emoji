## [[Implicit Differentiation]] 
Implicit differentiation is a technique used to find the [[derivative]] of a function that is defined implicitly, meaning that it is not explicitly solved for one variable in terms of the other. 

### The Basics

Let's consider an equation relating $x$ and $y$, such as:
# $$x^2 + y^2 = 25$$
We can't easily solve this equation for $y$ in terms of $x$. However, we can still find the [[derivative]] $\frac{dy}{dx}$ by using implicit differentiation.

**The key idea is to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$, treating $y$ as a function of $x$.** This means we'll use the [[chain rule]] whenever we encounter a term involving $y$.

# Steps for [[Implicit Differentiation]] 
[[1. **Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$.** Remember to use the [[chain rule]] when differentiating terms involving $y$. 
2. **Solve the resulting equation for $\frac{dy}{dx}$.** This may involve algebraic manipulation.

### Example

Let's find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ for the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$.

[[1. **Differentiate both sides:**
   $$\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(25)$$
   $$2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$

2. **Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$:**
   $$2y \frac{dy}{dx} = -2x$$
   $$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-2x}{2y} = \boxed{-\frac{x}{y}}$$

### [[Chain Rule]]

The [[chain rule]] is essential for implicit differentiation. It states that the [[derivative]] of a composite function is the product of the [[derivative]] of the outer function and the [[derivative]] of the inner function.

**In the context of implicit differentiation, the inner function is often $y$, which is a function of $x$.** 

For example, if we have a term like $y^3$, we differentiate it as follows:

$$\frac{d}{dx}(y^3) = 3y^2 \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}$$

Here, $y^3$ is the outer function, $y$ is the inner function, and $\frac{dy}{dx}$ represents the [[derivative]] of the inner function.
### Applications of [[Implicit Differentiation]] 
Implicit differentiation has various applications, including:

* **Finding the slope of a tangent line to a curve defined implicitly.**
* **Determining the critical points of a function defined implicitly.**
* **Solving related rates problems involving implicit equations.**

### Summary

Implicit differentiation is a powerful tool for finding derivatives when a function is defined implicitly. By treating $y$ as a function of $x$ and applying the [[chain rule]], we can successfully differentiate both sides of the equation and solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$. This technique is valuable in various applications across calculus and other fields.
