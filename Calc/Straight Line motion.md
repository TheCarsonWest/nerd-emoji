### [[1. Position, Velocity, and Acceleration

* **Position Function:**  The position function, denoted by $s(t)$, describes the location of an object at a given time $t$.
## $$s(t) = \text{The position of an object at time }t \text{ on a single axis}$$
* **Velocity Function:** The velocity function, denoted by $v(t)$, represents the rate of change of the object's position with respect to time. Mathematically: 
# $$v(t) = \frac{ds(t)}{dt}$$
Since velocity is speed and direction, and the sign is a direction($+$ or $-$), the absolute value is the speed of the object

# $$Speed = |v(t)|$$

* **Acceleration Function:** The acceleration function, denoted by $a(t)$, represents the rate of change of the object's velocity with respect to time. Mathematically:
# $$a(t) = \frac{dv(t)}{dt} = \frac{d^2s(t)}{dt^[[2]}$$

|          | $a(t)>0$     | $a(t)<0$     | $a(t)=0$       |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| $v(t)>0$ | speeding up  | slowing down | constant speed |
| $v(t)<0$ | slowing down | speeding up  | constant speed |
| $v(t)=0$ | stopped      | stopped      | stopped        |
