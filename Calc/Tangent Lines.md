## [[Tangent Lines]] in Calculus AB

### Introduction

A tangent line is a line that touches a curve at a single point and has the same slope as the curve at that point. Tangent lines are fundamental concepts in calculus because they allow us to approximate the behavior of a function near a specific point.

### Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line

To find the equation of a tangent line to a curve $y=f(x)$ at a point $(a, f(a))$, we follow these steps:

1. **Find the slope of the tangent line.** This slope is equal to the [[derivative]] of the function at $x=a$, denoted by $f'(a)$.

2. **Use the point-slope form of a line.** The point-slope form of a line is given by:
    $$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$
    where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. In our case, $m = f'(a)$ and $(x_1, y_1) = (a, f(a))$.

3. **Substitute the values into the point-slope form and simplify to get the equation of the tangent line.**

### Example

Let's find the equation of the tangent line to the curve $y = x^2$ at the point $(2, 4)$.

1. **Find the [[derivative]]:** $f'(x) = 2x$.

2. **Evaluate the [[derivative]] at $x=2$:** $f'(2) = 4$.

3. **Use the point-slope form:**
    $$y - 4 = 4(x - 2)$$

4. **Simplify:**
    $$y = 4x - 4$$

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to the curve $y = x^2$ at the point $(2, 4)$ is $y = 4x - 4$.

### Derivatives and [[Tangent Lines]] 
The [[derivative]] of a function at a point gives the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at that point. This connection between derivatives and tangent lines is crucial in calculus.

For example, if the [[derivative]] of a function is positive at a point, the tangent line at that point will have a positive slope, indicating that the function is increasing at that point. Similarly, if the [[derivative]] is negative, the tangent line will have a negative slope, indicating that the function is decreasing.

### [[Applications of Tangent Lines]]

Tangent lines have numerous applications in various fields, including:

* **Physics:** Tangent lines are used to find the velocity and acceleration of an object at a given time.

* **Engineering:** Tangent lines are used in design and optimization problems.

* **Economics:** Tangent lines are used to analyze marginal cost and marginal revenue.

### Visual Representation

```desmos-graph
y = x^2
y = 4x - 4
```

This graph shows the curve $y = x^2$ and the tangent line $y = 4x - 4$ at the point $(2, 4)$. We can see that the tangent line touches the curve at a single point and has the same slope as the curve at that point.

### Conclusion

Tangent lines are an essential concept in calculus, connecting the [[derivative]] of a function to the slope of its graph at a particular point. They have numerous applications in various fields and are crucial for understanding the behavior of functions.
