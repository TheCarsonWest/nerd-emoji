### [[Indeterminate Forms]] 
An indeterminate form is a limit expression that cannot be determined directly. These forms include:

* **0/0:**  The limit of a fraction where both the numerator and denominator approach zero.
* **∞/∞:** The limit of a fraction where both the numerator and denominator approach infinity.

When encountering these indeterminate forms, we can't simply substitute the value the variable is approaching because the result is undefined. This is where [[LHopitals Rule]] comes in.
