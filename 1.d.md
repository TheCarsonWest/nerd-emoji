UNIT 1 – PART 1
GEOGRAPHY – ITS NATURE AND PERSPECTIVES

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING (1.A)
By the end of this section, you will understand that geography, as a field of inquiry, looks at the world from a spatial perspective.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE (1.A.1)
By the end of this section, you will be able to explain the importance of geography as a field of study.
Geographic information provides context for understanding spatial relationships and human-environment interaction.

PART I: THE SPATIAL PERSPECTIVE
Essential question: How does the way geographers look at the world differ from that of others scientists?

PART I: THE SPATIAL PERSPECTIVE
Geography is the why of where.
Why are things where they are?
How did things become distributed as they are?
What is changing the pattern of distribution?
What are the implications of the spatial distribution for people?

GEOGRAPHY AS A FIELD OF STUDY
Geography (Greek)
Geo- (earth) 
-graphy (writing)
Subfields
Physical – elements of the physical environment (weather and climate) 
Human – spatial characteristics of humans and human activities

GEOGRAPHY AS A FIELD OF STUDY
Subfields of Human Geography
Population – health, births, migration, etc.
Culture – language, religion, popular music, etc.
Economics – agriculture, level of development, wealth, etc.
Urban areas – cities, suburbs, challenges from growth, etc.
Political  - local government, nations, distribution of power, etc.

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING (1.C)
By the end of this section, you will understand that geographical skills provide a foundation for analyzing world patterns and processes.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE (1.C.1)
By the end of this slide, you will be able to use spatial thinking to analyze the human organization of space.
People apply spatial concepts to interpret and understand population and migration; cultural patterns and processes; political organization of space; agriculture, food production, and rural land use; industrialization and economic development; and cities and urban land use.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE (1.C.2)
By the end of this section, you will be able to use and interpret maps.
Maps are used to represent and identify spatial patterns and processes at different scales
Types of maps include reference maps and thematic maps
All map projections inevitably distort spatial relationships

PART II: PATTERNS AND PROCESSES
Essential question: What tools and techniques do geographers use to analyze the world?

LEARNING OBJECTIVE (1.C.2)
By the end of this section, you will be able to use and interpret maps.
Maps are used to represent and identify spatial patterns and processes at different scales
Types of maps include reference maps and thematic maps
All map projections inevitably distort spatial relationships

MAPS
Maps are 2D representations of a geographical area. Maps cannot represent every aspect of a place; therefore a need for many types of maps
Cartographer, a mapmaker, will gather and use a large amount of data to draw maps to reveal  spatial patterns - arrangement of objects on Earth’s surface and spatial perspectives - explanation of the use of space

PROJECTIONS


We know that the earth is round and maps are flat
Therefore, all maps distort some aspect of reality (SADD – shape, area, distance, or direction)
The process of showing a curved surface on a flat surface is done using a map projection
There are 5 projections you need to know…

PROJECTIONS - MERCATOR
Why is the Mercator Projection useful for navigation? Why might it be less useful for geographic education?

PROJECTIONS - PETERS
Which world region is most accurately represented by the Peters projection?

PROJECTIONS – PETERS OVER MERCATOR

PROJECTIONS – GOODE-HOMOLOSINE
What are the benefits of dividing Earth into equal areas? 

PROJECTIONS - ROBINSON
Why do modern geographers tend to favor the Robinson projection?

PROJECTIONS - AZIMUTHAL

MAPS – REFERENCE AND THEMATIC
Reference Maps
Political – human-created boundaries (states, cities, etc.)
Physical – natural features (mountains, rivers, deserts)
Road – highways, streets, and alleys
Plat – property lines and land ownership
Locator – used in books and advertisements to support ad
What do reference maps allow you to see?

What limitations do reference maps have?


MAPS – REFERENCE AND THEMATIC
Thematic Maps
Show spatial aspects of information or of a phenomenon
Four common types
Choropleth
Dot distribution
Graduated symbol
Isoline 
What is the difference thematic and reference maps?



MAPS –THEMATIC: CHOROPLETH
Choropleth
Uses various colors, shades of one color, or patterns to show the location and distribution of spatial data

MAPS –THEMATIC: CHOROPLETH
Choropleth Aggregation & Manipulation 

*Data aggregation is the process collecting and organizing large amounts of information (usually in a cluster)


In the previous slide, Georgia had one of the highest number of African-Americans, but a closer look tells a different picture.  The dark red is the Atlanta metropolitan area.

Using Census Tracts of the Atlanta Metropolitan Area, a different scale gives different results.


This map shows the percentage of African-Americans living within counties across the US.

34

This map shows the total number of African-Americans living in each county across the US.

35

These four New York counties (New York, Kings, Queens, and Bronx) have a combined African-American population of 2,121,882 and outnumbers the total number of African-Americans in the entire state of Texas 2,021,632
36

MAPS –THEMATIC: DOT DISTRIBUTION
Dot Distribution
Used to show the specific location and distribution of something across the territory of the map
Each dot represents a specified quantity

MAPS –THEMATIC: GRADUATED SYMBOL
Graduated Symbol
Uses symbols of different sizes to indicate different amounts of something
The map key determines the exact amount

MAPS –THEMATIC: ISOLINE
Isoline
Uses lines that connect points of equal value to depict variations in the data across space
Where lines are close together, change is rapid
Most common type: topographic map 

MAPS –THEMATIC: ISOLINE
Topographic
Popular among hikers
Points of equal elevation are connected creating contours that depict surface features

MAPS – CARTOGRAMS
Cartograms
Sizes of countries are shown according to some specific statistic
Useful because they allow data to be compared, like a graph, and distance and distribution are also visible, like on a traditional map.

THINKING CRITICAL ABOUT MAPS
Notice how the data are aggregated
Determine whether a thematic map is representing raw numbers or percentages
Be cautious about assuming that conclusions based on a large geographic unit, such as US state or the entire country, apply to smaller portions of the state or the country
As you read a map, ask yourself who created it, why, and how a different cartographer might show the data differently.
Consider how the projection might be influencing your interpretation
Look at what is included and EXCLUDED on a map

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING (1.D)
By the end of this section, you will understand that geospatial technologies increase the capability for gathering and analyzing geographic information with applications to everyday life.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE (1.D.1)
By the end of this section, you will be able to use and interpret geospatial data
Geospatial technologies include GIS, GPS, remote sensing, and online mapping and visualization
Geospatial data is used at all scales for personal (navigation), business (marketing), and governmental (environmental planning) purposes

GEOSPATIAL DATA
Geospatial data includes all information that can be tied to a specific place
Locations, human activities, and traits
Examples:
Where do speakers of Chinese live?
How common is poverty in each U.S. county?
Where is the dividing line in a city between students who attend one high school and those who attend another?

GEOSPATIAL DATA – OBTAINING DATA
Much of the data is obtained through fieldwork – observing and recording information on location
Census of the population, interviews, informal observations

GEOSPATIAL DATA – TECHNOLOGIES
Global Positioning System (GPS)
Description: GPS receivers on Earth’s surface use the locations of multiple satellites to determine and record a receiver’s exact location
Uses: precisely locating border; navigating ships, aircraft, and cars; mapping lines (trails) or points (fire hydrants) 

GEOSPATIAL DATA – TECHNOLOGIES
Remote Sensing
Description: the use of cameras or other sensors mounted on aircraft or satellites to collect digital images of the earth’s surface
Uses: determining land cover and use; monitoring environmental changes; assessing spread of spatial phenomena; weather

GEOSPATIAL DATA – TECHNOLOGIES
Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
Description: computer system that can store, analyze, and display information from multiple digital maps or geospatial data sets
Uses: analysis of crime data; effects of pollution; transportation/travel time analysis; urban planning

THE LONDON SUBWAY MAP
One of the most useful, yet inaccurate, maps
Shows the value of the concept of relative location
Passengers did not need to know the twists and turns of the track or the actual distance between stops

THE LONDON SUBWAY MAP

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING (1.C)
Remember, by the end of this section, you will understand that geographical skills provide a foundation for analyzing world patterns and processes.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE (1.C.7-8)
By the end of this section, you will be able to define region as a concept, identify world regions, and understand regionalization processes.
Definition of region
Types of regions
World regions

By the end of this section, you will be able to explain and evaluate the regionalization process.
Regional thinking and regionalism


REGIONALIZATION AND REGIONS
Regionalization is the process geographers use to divide and categorize space into smaller areal units – the same way a writer divides a book into chapters and then names (classifies) them. 
Three types of regions
Formal
Functional
Vernacular 


TYPES OF REGIONS: FORMAL
Formal regions, sometimes called uniform regions or homogenous regions, are united by one or more traits
Physical – the Sahara, a vast desert in North Africa
Cultural – southwestern Nigeria, an area where most people speak Yoruba
Economic – Gold Coast of Africa (Ghana), which exports gold


TYPES OF REGIONS: FUNCTIONAL
Functional regions, or nodal regions, are organized around a focal point and are defined by an activity that occurs across the region
Often united by communication or transportation that are centered around a node
Region: pizza delivery area; Node: pizza shop
Region: a country; Node: capital city (political node)

TYPES OF REGIONS: PERCEPTUAL
Perceptual regions, or vernacular regions, are defined by the informal sense of place that people ascribe to them and vary widely
The American “South”
The Middle East
“Upstate” New York
The exact boundaries depend upon the person who is defining them

WORLD REGIONS – LARGE REGIONS
Geographers divide the world into regions and subregions

WORLD REGIONS – SUBREGIONS
Subregions are large regions divided into smaller sections
They share some characteristics with the rest of the larger region but is distinctive in some ways
Example: Latin America covers parts of North and South America, from Mexico to Chile. As in most Latin American countries, most people in Brazil are Roman Catholics. However, most Brazilians speak Portuguese. Because of its language, Brazil is a distinct subregion.

WORLD REGIONS – SUBREGIONS

WORLD REGIONS – SMALLER REGIONS
Subregions can be divided into smaller regions and can be based on elements of physical geography, such as climate and landform, or human geography, such as culture, politics, or economics
Any one place is part of many regions or subregions
Example: Florida is part of a climate region base on its warm weather, a cultural region known as the South, and an economic region known as the Sun Belt.

PART II: PATTERNS AND PROCESSES
Geographers emphasize spatial patterns, general arrangements of things being studied, and the processes, the repeated sequences of events, that create them.

MAPS
Scale
Maps are a reduction of the actual land it represents
Scale is the ratio between the size of things in the real world and the size of those same things on the map
Three types: cartographic, geographic, and scale of data

MAPS - SCALE
Scale
Maps are a reduction of the actual land it represents
Scale is the ratio between the size of things in the real world and the size of those same things on the map
Three types: cartographic, geographic, and scale of data

MAPS - SCALE
Cartographic Scale
Refers to the way the map communicates the ratio of its size to the size of what it represents:
Words – one inch equals ten miles (2.5 inches would equal 25 miles on the surface of the earth
Ratio – 1/200,000 or 1:200,000 (1 unit on the map equals 200,000 units on the ground)
Line – length of the line indicates distance on the map

MAPS - SCALE
Geographic Scale
Think of how an election shows the importance of using various scales?
Name the correct geographic scale for the following scenarios:
How does COVID spread across sub-Saharan Africa?
How is the government of a specific country  responding to a COVID outbreak?
What are the global effects of the spread of COVID?
How many people in a particular town are quarantined because of COVID?
Which scale is larger? Global or local?

MAPS - SCALE
Change in Scale = Change in Perspective 


MAPS - SCALE
Scale of the Data
The scale of the maps might be the same but the scale of the data may be different

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING (1.B)
By the end of this section, you will understand that geography offers a set of concepts, skills, and tools that facilitate critical thinking and problem solving.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE (1.B.1)
By the end of this section, you will be able to explain major geographical concepts underlying the geographic perspective.
Geographic concepts include location, place, scale, space, pattern, nature and society, networks, flows, regionalization, and globalization.

CONCEPTS
Historians look through the lens of time to understand the past.

Geographers look through the lens of space to understand place.

LOCATION
Absolute location
Absolute location - the precise spot where something is according to some system
Most widely used: latitude and longitude
Latitude: distance north or south of the equator (0° lat)
Longitude: distance east or west of the prime meridian (0° long)
Prime meridian passes through Greenwich, England
International Date Line (180° long)


LEARNING OBJECTIVE (1.B.1)
By the end of this section, you will be able to explain major geographical concepts underlying the geographic perspective.
Geographic concepts include location, place, scale, space, pattern, nature and society, networks, flows, regionalization, and globalization.

DISTANCE
Distance is the measurement of how far or how near things are to one another
Proximity indicates the degree of nearness
Meters, miles, kilometers, etc.
Straight line distance (as the crow flies) or travel distance
Example: Milwaukee to Kalamazoo is 130 miles by air but 250 miles by car



LOCATION

LOCATION
Relative location
Relative location - where something is in relation to other things
Example: Salt Lake City, Utah is located just south of the Great Salt Lake and just west of the Rocky Mountains
Often described in terms of connectivity (how well two locations are tied together by roads or other links) and accessibility (how quickly and easily people in one location can interact with people in another location)


LOCATION
Relative location
Can change over time and as accessibility changes
Example: ghost towns (abandoned settlements) of the western United States once had relative locations near water sources (which dried up), along trade routes (which changed), or near mines (which closed).
Their relative locations lost the advantages (resources or trade) but their absolute locations remain the same.


PLACE
Place
Place refers to the specific human and physical characteristics of a location.
A group of places in the same area that share a characteristic form a region.
Two ways to refer to place: site and situation
Site: characteristics at the immediate location (soil type, climate)
Situation: location relative to surroundings  



PLACE
Place
Sense of place – humans tend to perceive the characteristics of places in different ways based on their personal beliefs.
Example: the characteristics of Rome, Italy, might be described differently by a local resident than by an outsider or by a Catholic than by a Hindu.
If a place inspires no strong emotional ties in people, it has placelessness.



PLACE
Place
Toponyms – place names
Some provide insights into the physical geography, the history, or the culture of the location
Example: coast of Florida (beach names), Salt Lake City, Los Angeles
Some can be confusing (Iceland and Greenland) while some are deceiving (Lake City, Iowa not on a lake and Mount Prospect, Illinois is only 665 ft above sea level)



DISTANCE
Distance is the measurement of how far or how near things are to one another
Proximity indicates the degree of nearness
Meters, miles, kilometers, etc.
Straight line distance (as the crow flies) or travel distance
Example: Milwaukee to Kalamazoo is 130 miles by air but 250 miles by car



DISTANCE
Distance and Time
Time-space compression is the shrinking “time distance” between locations because of improved methods of transportation and communication
Example: New York and London are separated by an ocean, but the development of air travel greatly reduced travel time between them and now feel much closer today than in the 19th century
Result: global forces are influencing culture everywhere and reducing local diversity more than ever before


DISTANCE
Distance and Connection
Spatial interaction refers to the contact, movement, and flow of things between locations – physical (through roads) or information (through radio or Internet) 
The increasing connection between places is reflected in the growth of spatial interaction
Friction of distance is the measure of how much absolute distance affects the interaction between two places
An example of friction of distance is the interaction that my friend and I had when we attended the same middle school in 8th, compared to different high schools in 9th, including online interaction.
Distance decay is the decrease or decay in interaction between two phenomena, places, or people as the distance between them increases, such as what happened with my friend and 

DISTANCE
Example: the weakening of a radio signal as it travels across space away from a radio tower – friction of distance causes the decay, or weakening, of the signal.
Improvements in transportation, communication, and infrastructure have reduced the friction as they have increased the spatial interaction.

DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION
Density
Density is the number of something in a specifically defined area
Population density is the number of people per square mile – count the people and divide by the area
Psychological density – in a full elevator, one person may think it feels fine while one person feels uncomfortable 

DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION
Distribution
Distribution is the way a phenomenon is spread out over an area
Clustered or sparse
For example, two city blocks with the same density (amount of people) might have very different distributions – evenly spread out vs. high-rise apartment and empty park
Geographers look for patterns in distribution: linear (towns along a railroad line), circular (homes of people who shop at a store), geometric (squares formed by roads), or random (pet owners)


DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION
Distribution
Matching patterns of distribution is called spatial association and indicates that two (or more) phenomena may be related, or associated with one another
Example: the distribution of malaria matches the distribution of the mosquito that carries it (be careful – correlation does not mean causation)
Example: distribution of bike shops in a large city might be similar to the distribution of athletic wear stores. One does not cause the other but may reflect the distribution of active people


ENDURING UNDERSTANDING (1.B)
By the end of this section, you will understand that geography offers a set of concepts, skills, and tools that facilitate critical thinking and problem solving.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE (1.B.2)
By the end of this section, you will be able to use landscape analysis to examine the human organization of space.
Landscape analysis (e.g., field observations, photographic interpretations) provides a context for understanding the location of people, places, regions, and events; human–environment relationships; and interconnections between and among places and regions

LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS
Landscape analysis is the task of defining and describing land
Observation and Interpretation
The first part of landscape analysis is field observation
Take notes, sketch maps, count, measure, and interview
Before technology, this was the only way to gather data about a place

LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS
Built environment refers to the physical artifacts that humans have created and that form part of the landscape
Examples: buildings, roads, signs, and fences
The built environment varies from place to place (think China vs. Germany)
Anything built by humans is part of the cultural landscape.

FOUR-LEVEL ANALYSIS
One  systematic way to study geographic phenomena is to use Four-Level Analysis. 
Level
Description
Key Questions
1. Comprehension
Establish the basic information clearly
What? Where? When? Scale?
2. Identification 

Identify and describe patterns in phenomena
Are phenomena connected?
3. Explanation
Explain how individual phenomena might form a pattern
Why is something where it is? How did it get there?
4. Prediction
Explain why a pattern is important, and predict what it might lead to
So what? What if? What are the effects?

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING (1.C)
Remember, by the end of this section, you will understand that geographical skills provide a foundation for analyzing world patterns and processes.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE (1.C.4)
By the end of this section, you will be able to use and interpret geographic models
Geographers use models as generalizations to think systematically about topics such as land use (e.g., von Thünen model, Latin American city model), industrial location (e.g., Weber model), and the distribution of settlements (e.g., Christaller’s central place theory)

MODELS IN GEOGRAPHY
Geographic models are representations of reality or theories about reality to help them see general spatial patterns, focus on the influence of specific factors, and understand variations from place to place.
Models help explain, describe, and sometimes even predict spatial activity and phenomena.
Two basic types: spatial and non-spatial

MODELS IN GEOGRAPHY - SPATIAL
Spatial models illustrate theories about spatial distributions
Example: agricultural land use – Von Thünen model
Example: industrial location – least cost theory
Example: distribution of cities – central place theory

MODELS IN GEOGRAPHY – NON-SPATIAL
Non-spatial models illustrate theories and concepts using words, graphs, or tables. They often depict changes over time rather than across space.
Example: demographic transition model (DTM)
Example: Rostow’s modernization model
Example: Wallerstein’s world-systems theory combines both spatial and non-spatial

FORMULAS AND GRAPHS
Formulas help geographers understand how the world works and function much like models
Mathematical calculations used to produce statistics
Determine CBR and CDR
Doubling times for population
Population densities
Theoretical formulas produce results that are more theoretical
Rank-size rule
Graphs illustrate population structures (pyramids), geographic concepts (distance-decay), and even models (DTM)

USE OF MODELS
Von Thünen Model
Generalization – based on what people did, he developed a general model about agricultural land use
Simplification – focused on two variables (transportation and distance)
Theoretical – could be applied around the world but would never exactly match reality
Models are never really right or wrong but are useful in understanding the world
