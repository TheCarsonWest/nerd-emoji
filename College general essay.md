Imagine yourself 1 mile out from any land in every direction. Most people wouldn't know what to do with themselves. The thought of having to swim for that much distance would scare most people, most people wouldn't even know how long it would take to swim back to shore, or if they even could. For me, it means I have a mile left to race.

The sport of open water swimming is a mental and physical challenge like no other. With events that are 2 to 12 times longer than the longest events swam in the pool, with the added difficulty of the wind pushing you back, waves blasting you, the water burning you or freezing you depending on the season, and the frequent battles with your opponents in the water, only a small minority of swimmers ever even attempt to swim open water. 

No matter the distance, whether it be 3, 5, or 10 Kilometers, [whether you gave it your all or didn't], you will come out of that lake, or ocean, wrecked from exhaustion.

But for me, there's not much else that gives me more focus for such an extended period of time. Being on the smaller side of my competitors, I have to use my head more than they do, as this is the only format of swimming where race strategy can win over raw power. 

Every move I make is calculated. I show up to the race earlier than everyone else, so I can position myself on the start line wherever I think will let me best get a run to the front. When I sit behind someone in a draft, I try to figure out if they are too tired to defend from me passing them. When I pass someone, I will intentionally swim away laterally, trading seconds off of my time in order to secure my position.

[Something about how despite how I should lose this on paper, being slower than a lot of these people in the pool, my mentality and strategy win out over them]

This exemplifies my strategic approach in life, I try to find whatever advantage I can

Because I find that no matter the pain that goes into getting there, there is no better feeling than being the first person out of the water 

Most of my friends, many of them swimmers themselves, think I am crazy for my love of open water. But the race that most people
