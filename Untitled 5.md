| Nick Carraway  | Non-Judgmental/Reserved: He prides himself on reserving judgment. "Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope" (Fitzgerald 1).<br>    Honest: He believes he is one of the few honest people he knows.  "I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known" (Fitzgerald 59).                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Idealistic/Disillusioned: He seems to want to believe in the best of people, but is also aware of the corruption around him.<br>    Observant: He is keen on noticing details about people and situations. "Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction--Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn" (Fitzgerald 2). | Young: He is described as returning from the war and relatively new to the East. <br>    Ordinary: While not explicitly described in great detail, his lack of striking features suggests a certain "everyman" quality.<br>                                                                                                                      | Neutral/Cautious: He seems like a reliable narrator but also potentially naive or easily impressed. |
| Jordan Baker   | Self-Assured/Cynical: She has a detached confidence. "She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and one arm was extended, waiting to be taken by someone who was coming to tea" (Fitzgerald 8).<br>    Bored/Restless: She seems unimpressed by the Buchanans and the superficiality of their life. "Then she yawned. 'I did live them,' she said finally. 'But I don't care'" (Fitzgerald 17).                                                                                     | World-Weary: She seems to have seen it all and is unimpressed.<br>    Privileged: She expects to be catered to and to move through life effortlessly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Athletic: She is a golfer, suggesting a lean and active build. <br>    Slender: Described as having a "slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet" (Fitzgerald 9).                                                                            | Intrigued/Suspicious: She seems interesting but potentially dishonest or uncaring.                  |
| Daisy Buchanan | Charming/Superficial: She possesses a captivating voice and manner, but seems to lack depth.  "I'm p-paralyzed with happiness" (Fitzgerald 8).<br>    Sad/Restrained: There's an underlying sadness beneath her bright facade. "That's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool" (Fitzgerald 17).                                                                                                                                                                                           | Cynical about Marriage/Society: Her comment about wanting her daughter to be a "beautiful little fool" suggests a pessimistic view of women's roles.<br>    Aware of Societal Expectations: She understands the constraints placed upon women in her social circle.                                                                                                                     | Beautiful: Her beauty is emphasized, especially her voice. "Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget" (Fitzgerald 9). <br>    Fragile: Her delicate appearance hints at vulnerability. | Sympathetic/Uneasy: She seems trapped and possibly unhappy, but also complicit in her situation.    |
| Tom Buchanan   | Arrogant/Aggressive: He displays a dominating and entitled demeanor. "Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward" (Fitzgerald 7).<br>    Racist/Prejudiced: He expresses openly racist views.  "Civilization's going to pieces... Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?" (Fitzgerald 13). | Believes in Maintaining the Status Quo: He is resistant to change and clings to traditional power structures.<br>    Entitled: He feels he deserves everything he has and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Muscular/Imposing: His physical strength is emphasized.  "A cruel body" (Fitzgerald 7). <br>    Wealthy/Ostentatious: His lifestyle and home reflect his immense wealth.                                                                                                                                                                         | Disgusted/Repelled: He comes across as a bully and deeply unpleasant.                               |
using this information from the table, make an outline for this following task
In chapter one of The Great Gatsby you got to meet Daisy, Nick, Jordan and Tom. These characters will continue to be important during the story. Select one of the four characters to analyze. You will illustrate the image to include a drawing of the character  and descriptions about the character’s personality and biography (this should include at least ten items for the character), including two quotations from the book. Under the image write a few sentences explaining the type of person this character seems to be and use the details you found in your analysis of them to support your answer. This response should include at least once piece of text evidence, and explains how the quotation supports the response.      


Okay, here's an outline for the task of analyzing one of the four characters from Chapter 1 of The Great Gatsby, incorporating the information from the table and the specific requirements of the assignment:

**I. Character Selection:**

*   **Choose one character:** Nick Carraway, Jordan Baker, Daisy Buchanan, or Tom Buchanan. (For the sake of example, let's choose **Daisy Buchanan** for this outline).

**II. Image Creation (Illustration):**

*   **Description of Image:**
    *   Type of image (drawing, painting, digital art, etc.)
    *   Visual elements that represent Daisy's character (e.g., elegant dress, sad expression, pearls, setting of the Buchanan's mansion).
    *   Overall tone and mood of the image.

**III. Character Analysis (Ten Items - Personality and Biography):**

*   **Introduction:** Briefly introduce Daisy Buchanan.
*   **Personality Traits (at least 4-5):**
    *   Charming/Superficial: (From the table)
    *   Sad/Restrained: (From the table)
    *   Consider mentioning the "beautiful fool" quote and its implications (Fitzgerald 17).
    *   Suggestible/Impressionable
    *   Self-Absorbed
*   **Biographical Details (at least 5-6):**
    *   Married to Tom Buchanan
    *   Mother to a daughter
    *   Lives in East Egg
    *   Cousin to Nick Carraway
    *   Known Jordan Baker for many years
    *   Past relationship with Gatsby (implied)
*   **Quotations (Two Direct Quotes from Chapter 1):**
    *   "I'm p-paralyzed with happiness" (Fitzgerald 8).  (Use this to illustrate her superficiality or possibly her forced happiness.)
    *   "That's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool" (Fitzgerald 17). (Use this to illustrate her cynicism about women's roles in society.)

**IV. Character Summary and Interpretation (Under the Image):**

*   **Thesis Statement:** State the type of person Daisy *seems* to be based on the initial impression in Chapter 1.  (Example: "Daisy Buchanan presents herself as a charming socialite, but beneath the surface lies a deep-seated unhappiness and a cynical understanding of her limited options.")
*   **Supporting Details (from analysis):**
    *   Elaborate on her charm and how she uses it.
    *   Discuss the sadness that seems to linger beneath the surface.
    *   Analyze the implications of her comment about wanting her daughter to be a "beautiful little fool."  Connect this to her own experiences and societal expectations.
*   **Textual Evidence and Explanation:**
    *   Reiterate one of the quotations from above (e.g., "That's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool").
    *   Explain *how* this quotation supports the thesis statement. (Example: "This statement reveals Daisy's disillusionment with the limited roles available to women in her society. She understands that beauty is her primary asset and that a lack of awareness may be the only way to achieve some semblance of happiness within those constraints.")
*   **Concluding Sentence:** Summarize the overall impression of Daisy Buchanan based on Chapter 1.

**V. Formatting and Presentation:**

*   Ensure the image is clear and well-presented.
*   The character analysis is organized and easy to read.
*   Quotations are accurately cited using MLA format.
*   The summary is concise and well-supported.
