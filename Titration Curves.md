# [[Acids and Bases]]
# Titration Curves

Titration curves are graphical representations of the pH of a solution during a titration. They provide valuable information about the strength of the acid and base involved and the equivalence point of the reaction.

## I. Strong Acid - Strong Base Titrations

*   **Characteristics:** These titrations exhibit a rapid pH change near the equivalence point.
*   **Equivalence Point:** The equivalence point in a strong acid-strong base titration is at pH = 7.
*   **Curve Shape:** The curve starts at a low pH (highly acidic), gradually increases as base is added, shows a sharp jump around pH 7, and then levels off at a high pH (highly basic).
*   **Example:** Titration of HCl with NaOH.

    $$HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \rightarrow NaCl(aq) + H_2O(l)$$

## II. Weak Acid - Strong Base Titrations

*   **Characteristics:** The initial pH is higher than in strong acid titrations, and the pH change near the equivalence point is less drastic. A buffer region exists before the equivalence point.
*   **Equivalence Point:** The equivalence point is at pH > 7 due to the formation of the conjugate base of the weak acid.
*   **Curve Shape:** The curve starts at a higher pH than strong acid titrations, shows a gradual increase, has a buffering region, a smaller pH jump at the equivalence point, and then levels off at a high pH.
*   **Half-Equivalence Point: [[Half-Equivalence Point]]**
*   **Example:** Titration of acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$) with NaOH.

    $$CH_3COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) \rightarrow CH_3COONa(aq) + H_2O(l)$$

## III. Weak Base - Strong Acid Titrations

*   **Characteristics:** Similar to weak acid-strong base titrations, but the curve is inverted.
*   **Equivalence Point:** The equivalence point is at pH < 7 due to the formation of the conjugate acid of the weak base.
*   **Curve Shape:** The curve starts at a high pH (basic), gradually decreases as acid is added, has a buffering region, a smaller pH jump at the equivalence point, and then levels off at a low pH (acidic).
*   **Example:** Titration of ammonia ($NH_3$) with HCl.

    $$NH_3(aq) + HCl(aq) \rightarrow NH_4Cl(aq)$$

## IV. Polyprotic Acid Titrations

*   **Characteristics:** Acids with multiple ionizable protons ($H^+$) exhibit multiple equivalence points, one for each proton.
*   **Curve Shape:** The titration curve will have multiple buffer regions and equivalence points. The number of equivalence points corresponds to the number of acidic protons.
*   **Example:** Titration of sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$) with NaOH.

    $$H_2SO_4(aq) + NaOH(aq) \rightarrow NaHSO_4(aq) + H_2O(l)$$
    $$NaHSO_4(aq) + NaOH(aq) \rightarrow Na_2SO_4(aq) + H_2O(l)$$

## V. Indicators

*   [[Acid-Base Indicators]] are weak acids or bases that change color depending on the pH of the solution.
*   The appropriate indicator should be chosen such that its color change occurs within the rapid pH change region near the equivalence point.
*   The pH range where the indicator changes color is called the **transition interval**.

## VI. Determining the Equivalence Point

*   **Graphical Method:** The equivalence point is located at the steepest point on the titration curve. For polyprotic acids, it's at the midpoint of each steep section.
*   **First Derivative Plot:** The equivalence point corresponds to the maximum of the first derivative of the titration curve.
*   **Second Derivative Plot:** The equivalence point corresponds to the point where the second derivative crosses zero.

## VII. Calculations

*   **Stoichiometry:** At the equivalence point, the moles of acid and base are stoichiometrically equivalent.
*   **Weak Acid/Base Equilibria:** Use [[ICE Tables]] and $K_a$ or $K_b$ values to calculate the pH at various points along the titration curve, especially in the buffer region.
*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**  $pH = pK_a + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$ (for weak acid titrations). This is useful for calculating the pH in the buffer region. $pOH = pK_b + log \frac{[HB^+]}{[B]}$ (for weak base titrations).

## VIII. Important Considerations

*   **Temperature:** Temperature can affect $K_w$, $K_a$, and $K_b$ values, which can influence the shape of the titration curve and the pH at the equivalence point.
*   **Concentration:** The concentration of the acid and base affects the steepness of the curve near the equivalence point. More concentrated solutions result in a steeper curve.
