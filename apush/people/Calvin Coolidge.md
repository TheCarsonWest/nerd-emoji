*   **Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928):** While not directly involved in its creation, Coolidge signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, an international agreement that outlawed war. It was largely symbolic.

## Important Legislation:

*   **Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926:** These acts significantly reduced income tax rates, especially for the wealthy.

## Impact on the [[United States]]:

*   **Reduced Government Debt:** Coolidge was committed to reducing the national debt, and he succeeded in lowering it during his presidency.
*   **Laissez-Faire Economics:** Coolidge's belief in minimal government intervention in the economy is a hallmark of his presidency. This approach, while contributing to growth, also arguably contributed to the conditions that led to the [[Great Depression]].

His emphasis on tax cuts and deregulation is still debated today.
