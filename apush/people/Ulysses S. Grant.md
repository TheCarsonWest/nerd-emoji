## Overview

Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant) was the 18th [[POTUS]] (1869-1877), serving two terms marked by both significant achievements in [[Reconstruction]] and widespread corruption within his administration.

    *   **Panic of 1873:** A severe economic depression that plagued Grant's second term, diverting attention and resources from [[Reconstruction]].

## Important Legislation Signed

*   **Supported African American Suffrage:** Grant publicly supported the rights of African Americans to vote and participate in the political process.

## Impact on the Country

*   **Preservation of the Union:** Grant's military leadership was critical to preserving the [[United States]] during the [[Civil War]].
*   **Advancement of Civil Rights (Limited):** His administration took steps to protect the rights of African Americans during [[Reconstruction]], but these efforts were ultimately undermined by resistance in the South, economic problems, and a decline in Northern support.
*   **Corruption and Scandals:** Grant's presidency was marred by numerous scandals, including:
    *   **Credit Mobilier Scandal:** Involved fraudulent stock deals related to the [[Transcontinental Railroad]].

    *   **Indian Ring:** Government officials accepted bribes from contractors dealing with Native American affairs.
*   **Weakened Reconstruction:** The scandals and the [[Panic of 1873]] weakened public support for [[Reconstruction]], ultimately contributing to its failure.
*   **Native American Policy:** Grant implemented a "Peace Policy" toward Native Americans, aiming to assimilate them into American society. However, this policy was often undermined by corruption and violence.
*   **Legacy of Division:** While Grant sought to unite the nation after the [[Civil War]], his presidency highlighted the deep divisions that remained, particularly over race and economic inequality.
