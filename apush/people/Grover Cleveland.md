# Grover Cleveland: AP [[United States]] History Rundown

Stephen Grover Cleveland (1837-1908) was the 22nd and 24th [[POTUS]], serving two non-consecutive terms (1885-1889 and 1893-1897). A staunch believer in limited government and fiscal conservatism, Cleveland's presidency was marked by significant economic challenges and a commitment to upholding the gold standard.

## Background and Early Career
*   Born in Caldwell, [[New Jersey]].
*   Practiced law in Buffalo, [[New York]], gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity.
*   Rose through local politics, serving as Mayor of Buffalo and Governor of [[New York]]. His reputation for fighting corruption earned him the nickname "Grover the Good."

## Presidential Terms

### First Term (1885-1889)

*   **Election of 1884:** Won against Republican James G. Blaine in a close and scandal-ridden election. Cleveland's image of reform contrasted with Blaine's history of alleged corruption.
*   **Civil Service Reform:** Strengthened the [[Pendleton Act]], advocating for merit-based appointments in government and combating the [[Spoils System]].
*   **Tariff Reform:** Believed high tariffs were unfair to consumers and advocated for their reduction, leading to conflict with protectionist interests.
*   **Interstate Commerce Act (1887):** Signed the [[Interstate Commerce Act 1887]], establishing the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate railroads. This marked an early attempt by the federal government to regulate business.
*   **Dawes Act:** While not directly involved in its creation, the implementation of the [[Dawes Severalty Act of 1887]] continued during his presidency. This Act aimed to assimilate Native Americans by dividing tribal lands into individual allotments.

### Second Term (1893-1897)

*   **Panic of 1893:** His second term was largely defined by the severe economic depression known as the [[Panic of 1893]]. This crisis led to widespread unemployment, business failures, and social unrest.
*   **Gold Standard:** Firmly believed in maintaining the [[Gold Standard]] and opposed the free coinage of silver. He believed it was essential for maintaining the nation’s credit.
*   **Sherman Silver Purchase Act:** Blamed the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] for contributing to the economic crisis. He successfully pressured Congress to repeal it in 1893.
*   **Pullman Strike (1894):** Intervened in the [[Pullman Strike]], sending federal troops to ensure the delivery of mail, sparking controversy and angering organized labor.
*   **Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act (1894):** Signed this tariff act, which was intended to lower tariffs but was heavily amended in the Senate, becoming less reform-oriented than Cleveland desired. He was so displeased with the final bill that he refused to sign it, but it became law anyway.

## Important Legislation Signed

*   **[[Interstate Commerce Act 1887]]**
*   Repeal of the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]]

## Impact on the Country

He left a complex legacy as a president who attempted to uphold traditional values in a rapidly changing nation.
