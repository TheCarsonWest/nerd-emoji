# [[POTUS]]
# William Howard Taft: A Rundown
 

 ## Overview
 William Howard Taft (1857-1930) was the 27th [[POTUS]], serving from 1909 to 1913. He was also the 10th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, a position he held from 1921 until his death. Often overshadowed by his predecessor, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and successor, [[Woodrow Wilson]], Taft's presidency is marked by both successes and failures in continuing the [[Progressivism|Progressive Era]].
 

 ## Key Events and Associations
 

 *   **Governor-General of the Philippines (1901-1904):** Taft played a crucial role in establishing civil governance in the [[United States]]' new colony after the [[Spanish-American War]]. He focused on infrastructure development and improving relations with the Filipino people.
 *   **Secretary of War (1904-1908):** Under [[Theodore Roosevelt]], Taft managed the construction of the [[Panama Canal]] and served as a troubleshooter for various domestic and international issues.
 *   **Election of 1908:** Taft, hand-picked by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to be his successor, easily defeated [[William Jennings Bryan]] to win the presidency.
 *   **Pinchot-Ballinger Controversy (1909-1910):** This conflict between Gifford Pinchot (Chief of the Forest Service) and Richard Ballinger (Secretary of the Interior) highlighted the growing rift between Taft and the progressive wing of the [[Republicans]]. Pinchot accused Ballinger of undermining conservation efforts, and Taft's decision to fire Pinchot alienated many Progressives.
 *   **Election of 1912:** Taft ran for reelection as the Republican candidate but faced a strong challenge from [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who ran as a third-party candidate under the [[Bull Moose Party]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]], the [[Democrats]] candidate. The split in the Republican vote allowed Wilson to win the election.
 *   **Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (1921-1930):** Appointed by President Warren G. Harding, Taft became the only former president to serve as Chief Justice. He modernized the court's administration and advocated for judicial reform.
 

 ## Important Legislation Signed
 

 *   **Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act (1909):** Intended to lower tariffs, the act was heavily amended in Congress, resulting in only modest reductions and alienating Progressives who favored significant tariff reform.
 *   **Mann-Elkins Act (1910):** This act extended the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate telephone, telegraph, and cable companies.
 *   **Sixteenth Amendment (Proposed 1909, Ratified 1913):** Taft supported the proposal of this amendment, which authorized Congress to levy an income tax.

 ## Impact on the Country
 

 *   **Trust-Busting:** Taft's administration pursued more antitrust cases than [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s, including a significant case against Standard Oil.
 *   **Conservation:** While often criticized for his handling of the Pinchot-Ballinger affair, Taft also established several national forests and reserved significant amounts of public land.
 *   **Division within the Republican Party:** The growing divide between Taft and the Progressive wing of the Republican Party, led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], ultimately led to the party's split in the [[Election of 1912]] and the election of [[Woodrow Wilson]].
 *   **Judicial Reform:** As Chief Justice, Taft implemented reforms that streamlined the judicial process and increased the Supreme Court's influence.
 

 

 In conclusion, William Howard Taft's presidency was a complex period marked by both accomplishments and political challenges. While he continued some of the Progressive reforms of his predecessor, his conservative leanings and handling of key issues led to a major rift within the [[Republicans]] and ultimately contributed to his defeat in the [[Election of 1912]]. Despite the controversies, Taft made significant contributions to the country through his trust-busting efforts, conservation policies, and, later, his leadership on the Supreme Court.
