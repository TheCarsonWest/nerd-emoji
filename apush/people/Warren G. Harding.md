 ## Key Events and Associations
 

 *  **Election of 1920:** Harding, a [[Republicans|Republican]] Senator from Ohio, won the election on a platform of "[[Return to Normalcy]]", promising a retreat from international affairs and a focus on domestic prosperity. The election reflected the nation's weariness of war and the progressive fervor of the previous decades.
 *  **"Ohio Gang":** Harding's administration was plagued by corruption due to his appointment of friends and political allies, many from his home state of Ohio, to key positions. This group, known as the "Ohio Gang," engaged in various illegal activities.
 *  **Teapot Dome Scandal:** The most infamous scandal of Harding's presidency involved Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall, who accepted bribes in exchange for leasing government oil reserves at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, and Elk Hills, California, to private oil companies.

 ### Summary
 Harding's presidency is a complex mix of positive and negative legacies. While his pro-business policies contributed to economic growth, the corruption and scandals that plagued his administration overshadowed his achievements and left a lasting stain on his reputation and the office of [[POTUS]]. Harding's "[[Return to Normalcy]]" represented a shift in the national mood after World War I, but it also contributed to the rise of isolationism and a neglect of pressing social issues.
