# Abraham Lincoln: A Rundown

## Early Life and Career

*   Born February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in Kentucky.
*   Largely self-educated.
*   Worked various jobs, including rail-splitter, postmaster, and lawyer.
*   Served in the [[Illinois]] legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives (1847-1849) as a Whig.
*   His stance against the expansion of slavery gained him prominence.

## Rise to National Prominence

*   **New Republican Party 1850:** Lincoln joined the newly formed [[Republicans]], who opposed the expansion of slavery.
*   **[[Lincoln Douglas Debates]] (1858):**  A series of seven debates with Stephen Douglas during the Illinois Senate race.  These debates, particularly the [[Freeport Doctrine]], brought national attention to Lincoln and his views on slavery, even though he lost the election.
*   **[[Election of 1860]]:** Lincoln won the presidency with less than 40% of the popular vote, but with a majority of electoral votes. His victory triggered the secession of Southern states.

*   **Shermans March to Sea (1864):** Lincoln supported General Sherman's strategy of "total war" to break the Confederacy's will to fight.
*   **[[Surrender at Appomattox Courthouse]] (April 9, 1865):** General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant, effectively ending the Civil War.

## Wartime Policies and Legislation

*   **Suspension of [[Habaes Corpus civil war]]:** Lincoln suspended the right of *habeas corpus* to suppress dissent and rebellion, leading to the arrest and detention of thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.
*   **Morrill Tariff Act (1861):** Raised tariff rates to protect Northern industries and fund the war effort.
*   **Homestead Act (1862):** Provided 160 acres of public land to settlers who agreed to live on and cultivate it for five years, encouraging westward expansion.
*   **[[Transcontinental Railroad]]:** Facilitated by legislation during the war, though not directly signed by Lincoln, it was a project he strongly supported, leading to greater western settlement and economic growth.
*   **National Banking Act (1863):** Created a national banking system to stabilize the currency and finance the war.
