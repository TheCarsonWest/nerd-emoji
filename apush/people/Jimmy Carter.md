# [[POTUS]]
# Jimmy Carter: A Rundown

Jimmy Carter served as the 39th President of the [[United States]] from 1977 to 1981. A former peanut farmer and governor of Georgia, Carter ran as a Washington outsider, promising honesty and integrity. His presidency was marked by both notable achievements and significant challenges.

## Key Events and Associations:

*   **[[Energy Crisis 1973]]** (Continued): Carter inherited a nation grappling with the ongoing energy crisis. He famously wore a cardigan sweater on television to encourage energy conservation and pushed for alternative energy sources.
*   **[[Camp David Accords]]** (1978): Perhaps Carter's greatest achievement, he brokered a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel at Camp David. This landmark agreement earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.
*   **Iran Hostage Crisis** (1979-1981): Iranian students seized the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The crisis dominated Carter's presidency and contributed to his defeat in the 1980 election.
*   **Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan** (1979): Carter responded to the Soviet invasion by withdrawing the [[United States]] from the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow and increasing military aid to Pakistan.

## Important Legislation and Policies:

*   **Department of Energy (DOE)** (1977): Created to consolidate energy policy and promote energy conservation and development.
*   **Department of Education (ED)** (1979): Established as a cabinet-level agency to focus on education policy.
*   **Airline Deregulation Act (1978)**: Removed government control over airline fares and routes, leading to increased competition and lower prices.
*   **Panama Canal Treaties (1977)**: Transferred control of the [[Panama Canal]] to Panama. This was controversial at the time but seen by Carter as correcting a historical injustice.
*   **Human Rights Focus:** Carter made human rights a central tenet of his foreign policy, often criticizing countries, including allies, for human rights abuses.

## Groups and Affiliations:

*   **[[Democrats]]**: Carter was a member of the [[Democrats]], representing a more moderate, Southern wing of the party.
*   **Trilateral Commission**: Carter was a member of this non-governmental organization, which promotes cooperation between North America, Europe, and Japan.

## Impact on the Country:

*   **Focus on Human Rights:** Carter's emphasis on human rights had a lasting impact on American foreign policy, influencing subsequent administrations to consider human rights when dealing with other nations.
*   **Energy Policy:** The [[Energy Crisis 1973]] prompted Carter to push for energy conservation and alternative energy sources, laying the groundwork for future energy policies. However, his efforts were not enough to solve the crisis.
*   **Middle East Peace:** The [[Camp David Accords]] remain a significant achievement, demonstrating the potential for the [[United States]] to play a role in brokering peace in the Middle East.
*   **Public Perception:** Carter's image as an honest and well-intentioned leader was often overshadowed by the challenges he faced, particularly the Iran Hostage Crisis and [[Stagflation]]. This perception contributed to his loss to Ronald Reagan in 1980.
*   **Post-Presidency:** Carter has remained active in public life since leaving office, founding the Carter Center to promote peace and democracy around the world. He has also been involved in humanitarian efforts, such as eradicating diseases and monitoring elections.
