# [[POTUS]]
# Millard Fillmore: AP US History Rundown
 
 ## Overview
 Millard Fillmore (1800-1874) was the 13th [[POTUS]], serving from 1850 to 1853. He ascended to the presidency upon the death of Zachary Taylor. Fillmore's presidency was largely defined by his efforts to navigate the escalating tensions over slavery and preserve the Union. He is often viewed as a transitional figure whose policies ultimately failed to prevent the [[Civil War]].
 
 ## Key Events and Associations
 *   **Ascension to the Presidency (1850):** Fillmore became president upon the sudden death of [[Zachary Taylor]]. This unexpected transition thrust him into the center of the national debate over slavery.
 *   **The Compromise of 1850:** Fillmore played a crucial role in the passage of the [[Compromise of 1850]]. He supported the compromise and used his influence to garner support in Congress, contributing to a temporary easing of tensions between the North and South.
 *   **Opposition to Secession:** As tensions rose in the late 1850s and early 1860s, Fillmore became a vocal opponent of secession and supported efforts to preserve the Union. He publicly criticized both radical abolitionists and secessionists, viewing them as threats to the nation's stability.
 
 ## Important Legislation Signed
 *   **[[Compromise of 1850]]:** Though it was a series of bills, this "compromise" was effectively passed and signed under Fillmore's leadership. Key provisions included:
     *   Admission of [[California]] as a free state.
     *   [[Popular Sovereignty]] in the Utah and New Mexico territories (allowing residents to decide on slavery).
     *   A stronger [[Fugitive Slave Act]].
     *   Abolition of the slave trade in Washington D.C.
 
 ## Political Affiliations
 *   **Whig Party:** Fillmore was a member of the [[Whig Party]]. The party was increasingly divided over the issue of slavery.
 *   **Know-Nothing Party:** Later in life, after the collapse of the Whig Party, Fillmore briefly aligned himself with the [[Know-Nothing Party]], also known as the American Party, which was anti-immigrant and nativist. He ran as their presidential candidate in 1856.
 
 ## Impact on the Country
 *   **Delayed Secession:** The [[Compromise of 1850]], which Fillmore helped to enact, is often credited with delaying the outbreak of the [[Civil War]] by several years. It provided a temporary respite from the escalating tensions and allowed the nation more time to address the issue of slavery.
 *   **Increased Sectionalism:** While the Compromise of 1850 aimed to resolve sectional tensions, it also had the unintended consequence of exacerbating them. The [[Fugitive Slave Act]], in particular, angered many Northerners and intensified their opposition to slavery.
 *   **Weakening of the Whig Party:** Fillmore's support for the Compromise of 1850 further divided the [[Whig Party]], contributing to its eventual collapse in the mid-1850s. This created a power vacuum that allowed for the rise of new political parties, such as the [[Republicans]].
 
 ## Legacy
 Millard Fillmore's presidency is often viewed as a cautionary tale about the challenges of governing during times of deep division. His efforts to find a middle ground on the issue of slavery were ultimately unsuccessful, and his legacy remains controversial. While he is sometimes praised for delaying the Civil War, he is also criticized for his role in strengthening the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] and for his later association with the [[Know-Nothing Party]].
