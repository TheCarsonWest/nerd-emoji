## Events Associated With

*   **Battle of Tippecanoe (1811):** This battle, fought against the [[Native American]] forces of Tecumseh's Confederacy, made Harrison a national hero and earned him the nickname "Tippecanoe." It significantly weakened [[Native American]] resistance in the Northwest Territory.
*   **War of 1812:** Harrison commanded American forces in the Northwest, winning the Battle of the Thames in 1813, which resulted in the death of Tecumseh and the collapse of his confederacy. His military success contributed to the overall American victory in the war.
*   **Presidency (1841):** Harrison's presidency lasted only 31 days. He contracted pneumonia shortly after his inauguration and died soon after.

## Important Legislation Signed

*   Due to his extremely brief term, Harrison signed no significant legislation.

## Groups

*   **Whig Party:** Harrison was a prominent member of the [[Whig Party]]. The Whigs generally favored a strong national government, internal improvements, and a national bank. His election marked one of the Whig Party's most significant victories.

## Impact on the Country

*   **Military Hero:** Harrison's military career made him a symbol of American expansion and victory over [[Native Americans]]. This image played a crucial role in his political success.

*   **Whig Party Success:** His election demonstrated the [[Whig Party]]'s ability to win the presidency, even though their hold on power proved short-lived.
