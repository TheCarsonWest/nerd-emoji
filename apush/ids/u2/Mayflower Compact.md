## ID: [[Mayflower Compact]] 
## When: November 11, 1620

## Who: 
* Pilgrims (Separatist [[Puritans]]) aboard the Mayflower

## What: 
A social contract signed by 41 male Pilgrims aboard the Mayflower before landing at Plymouth. It established a civil government based on majority rule and committed the signatories to enact just and equal laws for the general good of the colony.  It was not a constitution, but a framework for self-governance.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Self-Governance:**  Established a precedent for self-government in the American colonies, preceding formal charters from the English crown. This demonstrated the colonists' desire for autonomy and their willingness to create their own governing structures.
* **Social Contract Theory:**  Represents an early example of a social contract, where individuals voluntarily surrender certain rights to form a government for mutual benefit and protection.  This idea would become central to American political thought.
* **Foundation of Plymouth Colony:** Provided a basis for the legal and social order of the Plymouth Colony, contributing to its relative success in the challenging early years.
* **Limited Scope:**  It only applied to the Pilgrims who signed it;  it did not establish a system for governing the broader indigenous populations.
* **Religious Motivation:**  While establishing a civil government, the compact was underpinned by the Pilgrims' strong religious beliefs and their desire to create a godly society in the New World.
