## ID: Sugar Act

## When: April 5, 1764

## Who:
* **British Parliament:**  Passed the act.
* **American Colonists:** Primarily affected by the increased taxes.

## What: 
An act of the British Parliament that raised revenue in the American colonies through taxes on imported sugar and molasses.  It lowered the existing tax rate on molasses but increased enforcement to ensure collection.  It also imposed taxes on other goods such as textiles and wines.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Increased Colonial Grievances:** The Sugar Act, along with other acts like the Stamp Act, fueled colonial resentment towards British taxation without representation.  Colonists argued that they should not be taxed by a government in which they had no voice.
* **Enforcement and Smuggling:**  The stricter enforcement measures led to increased tensions between colonists and British customs officials. Smuggling remained prevalent as colonists resisted the tax.
* **Precursor to Revolution:** The Act served as a significant step towards the American Revolution, highlighting the growing divide between Britain and its American colonies. It demonstrated Britain's intention to exert greater control over colonial trade and finances, prompting colonists to question their allegiance to the Crown.
* **Development of Colonial Resistance:** The Sugar Act spurred the development of colonial resistance strategies, including boycotts, protests, and the formation of political organizations to challenge British policies.  It contributed to the growth of a shared colonial identity united against British oppression.
