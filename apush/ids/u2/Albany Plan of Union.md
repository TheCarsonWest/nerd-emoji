## ID: [[Albany Plan of Union]] 
## When: June 1754

## Who:
* **[[Benjamin Franklin]]:** Primary author and proponent.
* **Representatives from seven colonies:**  Attended the Albany Congress.

## What: 
A proposal by [[Benjamin Franklin]] for a unified government for the thirteen British colonies in North America.  The plan called for a President-General appointed by the King and a Grand Council elected by the colonial legislatures. This unified government would handle issues such as defense, western expansion, and Native American relations.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **First significant attempt at colonial unity:**  The Albany Plan represented the first serious effort to create a unified government for the colonies before the American Revolution.  Though ultimately unsuccessful in its immediate aims, it laid the groundwork for future discussions about colonial unity and self-governance.
* **Illustrates growing colonial identity:** The very act of convening the Albany Congress and debating the plan indicates a growing sense of shared identity and purpose among the colonists.
* **Failure highlights inter-colonial tensions:** The plan's failure to be adopted by the colonial legislatures revealed the significant divisions and competing interests that existed among the colonies.  Colonies were wary of surrendering power to a central authority.
* **Precursor to later union efforts:** The Albany Plan's ideas about representation, taxation, and shared governance prefigured similar discussions that would take place during and after the American Revolution, ultimately leading to the creation of the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the [[United States]] Constitution.
