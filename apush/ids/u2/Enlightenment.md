## ID: The [[Enlightenment]] in America

## When: Late 17th Century - Late 18th Century (roughly 1680s-1780s)

## Who: 
* **Key Thinkers:** John Locke (influence paramount), Montesquieu, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (whose ideas had less direct impact than Locke's but still influenced later revolutionary thought).
* **American Adopters:** [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], and many Founding Fathers.  The general population, particularly educated elites, were also influenced.

## What: 
The [[Enlightenment]], a philosophical movement emphasizing reason, individualism, and skepticism, profoundly impacted American thought and the development of the nation.  Key ideas included natural rights (life, liberty, property – Locke), separation of powers (Montesquieu), and the social contract (Rousseau). These concepts fueled revolutionary sentiment and shaped the political and social structures of the newly formed [[United States]].  The [[Great Awakening]] (1730s-1740s) – a religious revival – also contributed to a questioning of authority and a focus on individual faith which overlapped and interacted with [[Enlightenment]] thought.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **[[Declaration of Independence]]:** Jefferson's articulation of natural rights directly reflects Locke's influence, justifying the American Revolution.
* **US Constitution:** The structure of the US government, with its emphasis on separation of powers and checks and balances, reflects Montesquieu's ideas. The [[Bill of Rights]] protects individual liberties consistent with [[Enlightenment]] principles.
* **Republicanism:** The [[Enlightenment]] fostered a shift away from monarchy and towards republican ideals of self-government and popular sovereignty.
* **Abolitionist Movement:**  While the [[Enlightenment]]'s legacy is complex concerning slavery, its emphasis on natural rights provided a moral basis for later abolitionist arguments.
* **Education and Scientific Inquiry:** The [[Enlightenment]] spurred advancements in education and scientific investigation, emphasizing reason and empirical observation.
