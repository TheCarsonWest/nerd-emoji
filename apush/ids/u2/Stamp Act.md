An act passed by the British Parliament that imposed a direct tax on the American colonies.  It required colonists to purchase special stamped paper for various documents and publications, including newspapers, legal documents, and playing cards.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Colonial Resistance:** The [[Stamp Act]] sparked widespread protests and boycotts throughout the American colonies.  Groups like the [[Sons of Liberty]] organized protests and demonstrations.

* **Increased Tensions:** The [[Stamp Act]] significantly escalated tensions between [[Great Britain]] and its American colonies, contributing to the growing divide that eventually led to the American Revolution.
* **Repeal (1766):** Due to the intense colonial resistance and economic disruption, the [[Stamp Act]] was repealed in 1766, though the Declaratory Act was passed simultaneously, asserting Parliament's right to tax the colonies.
* **Long-Term Impact:** The Stamp Act's legacy lies in its contribution to the development of colonial identity and the growing sentiment for independence from British rule.  It served as a key event in the chain of events leading up to the American Revolution.
