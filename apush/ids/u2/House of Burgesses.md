## ID: [[House of Burgesses]] 
## When: 1619-1776 (Established in 1619; dissolved in 1776)

## Who:
* **Members:** Elected representatives from various settlements in [[Virginia]].  Initially dominated by wealthy landowners and planters.  Representation gradually broadened over time, though limitations based on property ownership persisted.

## What:
The [[House of Burgesses]] was the first legislative assembly of elected representatives in the American colonies. It met regularly to debate and pass laws, taxes, and regulations for the Colony of [[Virginia]]. This represented a significant step toward self-government and established a precedent for other colonies.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Early Self-Government:** The [[House of Burgesses]] provided colonists with a voice in their own governance, even though it was under the ultimate authority of the British Crown.  It fostered a sense of self-reliance and political participation among colonists.
* **Development of Representative Government:** Its existence and evolution served as a model and provided valuable experience for the later development of representative government in other colonies and ultimately, the [[United States]].
* **Precedents for later conflicts:**  The gradual increase in the House of Burgess' influence, and their increasing confrontation with royal governors, laid the groundwork for future colonial resistance to British policies, culminating in the American Revolution.
* **Limited Representation:** It's important to acknowledge that the [[House of Burgesses]] did not represent all colonists; only landowning white men could vote or hold office. This unequal representation is key to understanding the limitations of colonial democracy.
