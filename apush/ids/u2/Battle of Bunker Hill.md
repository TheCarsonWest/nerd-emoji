## ID: Battle of Bunker Hill

## When: June 17, 1775

## Who:
* **British:** General William Howe and approximately 2,400 troops.
* **Colonials/Patriots:**  Colonel William Prescott (primarily) and approximately 1,500 militia from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.  

## What: 
A significant early battle of the American Revolutionary War, fought on Breed's Hill (inaccurate name that stuck). Although a tactical British victory, it demonstrated the Patriots' determination and military capability, boosting American morale and attracting more recruits. The battle involved a series of British assaults on the colonial fortifications. Despite their eventual retreat from the hill, the colonists inflicted heavy casualties on the better equipped and trained British army.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **American Resolve:** The battle proved that the American militia could stand up to the British Army, even if they ultimately lost the strategic position. This significantly boosted colonial morale and inspired further resistance.
* **British Casualties:**  The high number of British casualties (over 1,000) shocked Britain and showed the costly nature of suppressing the rebellion.
* **Recruitment:** The relatively successful defense, despite the loss, fueled colonial recruitment and solidified support for the Revolution.
* **Strategic Implications:** While a tactical victory for the British, it delayed their advance toward the siege of Boston and ultimately proved a pivotal battle in the early stages of the war, highlighting the Patriots' readiness to resist the British.
* **Tactical Learning:**  The battle provided both sides with valuable lessons in siege warfare and combat strategies. The British learned the hard way about attacking fortified positions. The Patriots refined their defensive tactics.
