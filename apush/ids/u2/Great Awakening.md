## ID: The [[Great Awakening]] 
## When: 1730s-1740s

## Who:
* **Religious Leaders:** Jonathan Edwards (New England), George Whitefield (traveling evangelist), Gilbert Tennent ([[New Jersey]])
* **Participants:**  Colonists from all social classes, although initially more prominent among the less affluent.

## What:
A series of religious revivals that swept through the American colonies.  Characterized by passionate preaching, emotional experiences, and a focus on personal conversion rather than traditional church hierarchies.  It emphasized individual piety and a direct relationship with God.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Religious Change:** Led to the growth of evangelical Protestantism and the formation of new denominations, such as Baptists and Methodists.  Challenged the authority of established churches (e.g., Congregationalists, Anglicans).
* **Social Change:** Transcended class divisions, uniting people from diverse backgrounds through a shared religious experience. However, it also sparked tensions and divisions within communities.
* **Political Impact:** Fostered a sense of shared identity and experience among colonists, contributing to a growing sense of American identity that later played a role in the Revolution.  The emphasis on individual conscience also had implications for later political thought.
* **Increased Literacy:** The desire to read the Bible spurred literacy rates.
* **Development of Colleges:**  New colleges were founded (e.g., Princeton, Dartmouth) to train ministers for the growing evangelical movement.
