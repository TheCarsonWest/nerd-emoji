## ID: [[Boston Massacre]] 
## When: March [[5], 1770

## Who:
* **British Soldiers:**  Part of the 29th Regiment of Foot, under the command of Captain Thomas Preston.
* **Colonists:** A crowd of mostly working-class Bostonians, including Crispus Attucks (a crucial figure often cited as the first to die).

## What: 
A violent confrontation between British soldiers and a group of colonists in Boston, [[Massachusetts]].  The incident began with escalating tensions and taunts between the colonists and the soldiers.  The soldiers fired into the crowd, killing five colonists and wounding several others.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Propaganda:** The [[Boston Massacre]] became a powerful symbol of British oppression used by colonial revolutionaries to rally support for their cause.  Paul Revere's famous engraving greatly exaggerated the event to further this purpose.
* **Increased Tensions:** The incident significantly heightened tensions between [[Great Britain]] and the American colonies, pushing the relationship closer to armed conflict.
* **Martyrdom:** The deaths of the colonists fueled anti-British sentiment and solidified the narrative of British tyranny. Crispus Attucksâ€™s death, in particular, became a powerful rallying cry.
* **Trial and Aftermath:**  Captain Preston and several soldiers were put on trial.  While some were convicted of manslaughter, the event demonstrated the legal complexities and the political climate of the time.
* **Stepping Stone to Revolution:** The [[Boston Massacre]] is viewed as one of several key events leading to the American Revolutionary War. It galvanized colonial resistance and further eroded trust in British rule.
