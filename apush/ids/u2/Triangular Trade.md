## ID: Triangular Trade

## When: Roughly 16th-19th centuries (peak activity 17th-18th centuries)

## Who:
* **Europeans:** Primarily British, French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese merchants and colonial powers.
* **Africans:**  West African kingdoms and tribes (some participated willingly through trade, others were victims of forced labor).
* **Americans:** Colonists in North America, the Caribbean, and South America who supplied raw materials and received manufactured goods.

## What:
A complex system of trade routes connecting Europe, Africa, and the Americas.  European manufactured goods (guns, textiles, alcohol) were traded for enslaved Africans in Africa.  Enslaved Africans were transported across the Atlantic ("Middle Passage") to the Americas, where they were sold to work on plantations producing raw materials (sugar, tobacco, cotton, etc.). These raw materials were then shipped back to Europe to complete the triangular cycle.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Economic Foundation:** Fueled the economic growth of European colonial powers and their American colonies.  Profits from the trade enriched merchants and fueled industrialization in Europe.
* **Forced Migration:** Led to the forced migration of millions of Africans across the Atlantic, resulting in the brutal institution of chattel slavery in the Americas.
* **Cultural Exchange:** While largely negative, some limited cultural exchange occurred between different groups of people.
* **Social Structures:** Shaped the social and racial hierarchies of the Americas, establishing systems of white supremacy and racial inequality that persisted for centuries.
* **Political Power:** The wealth generated from the Triangular Trade significantly influenced European politics and international relations.
* **Demographic Impact:**  The enormous loss of life among enslaved Africans profoundly affected demographics in both Africa and the Americas.
* **Moral and Ethical Concerns:** The inhumanity of the slave trade sparked growing abolitionist movements in Europe and the Americas in the 18th and 19th centuries.
