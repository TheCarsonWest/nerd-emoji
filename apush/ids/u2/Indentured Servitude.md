## ID: [[Indentured Servitude]] in Colonial America

## When:  1607-1776 (primarily 17th and early 18th centuries)

## Who:
* **Indentured Servants:** Primarily young, poor Europeans (English, Scots-Irish, Germans) seeking passage to the colonies.
* **Planters/Merchants:** Wealthy colonists in the Chesapeake ([[Virginia]], [[Maryland]]) and Southern colonies who needed labor for tobacco, rice, and other cash crops.

## What:
A system of labor in which individuals agreed to work for a specified number of years (typically [[4]]-[[7]]) in exchange for passage to the colonies, food, shelter, and sometimes land or tools upon completion of their service.  Conditions varied greatly, but often involved harsh treatment, long hours, and limited rights.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Colonial Economy:** Provided the crucial labor force that fueled the economic growth of the Southern colonies, particularly in agriculture.
* **Social Hierarchy:** Created a distinct social class below the elite planter class, contributing to social stratification and tensions.
* **Bacon's Rebellion (1676):**  Highlighted the growing discontent among indentured servants and freedmen, demonstrating the instability of the system.  This event pushed planters towards relying more heavily on enslaved Africans.
* **Rise of Slavery:** As indentured servitude declined, the reliance on enslaved Africans increased dramatically.  The cost of indentured servitude increased while the availability of enslaved Africans grew. This shift was a major turning point in the development of racial slavery in America.
* **Development of Racial [[Identity]]:** The growing reliance on enslaved Africans and the legal distinctions made between them and indentured servants contributed to the hardening of racial categories and the development of a system of racial hierarchy.
