## When: 1764-1776 (intensified after the Stamp Act of 1765)

## Who: 
* Colonial leaders and merchants in various colonies (e.g., Samuel Adams in Massachusetts)
* Initially local, then expanded into intercolonial networks

## What: 
Networks of communication established by patriot leaders in the thirteen American colonies.  These committees exchanged letters and information about British policies and colonial grievances, fostering a sense of unity and collective action against British rule.  They organized boycotts, disseminated propaganda, and coordinated resistance efforts.

## Impact: Why Significant?:

* **Spread of Propaganda:**  Disseminated information and pamphlets that fueled anti-British sentiment and mobilized colonial resistance.
* **Coordination of Resistance:**  Organized boycotts of British goods and coordinated colonial responses to British actions.
* **Early Steps Towards Revolution:**  Played a crucial role in escalating tensions with Britain and laying the groundwork for the American Revolution.  Their actions helped create a sense of shared grievance and collective purpose that proved essential in the eventual decision to declare independence.
* **Foundation of Revolutionary Organization:** The committees served as a precursor to the Continental Congress, demonstrating the capacity for colonial cooperation on a larger scale.
