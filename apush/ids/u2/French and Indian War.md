## ID: [[French and Indian War]] 
## When: 1754-1763

## Who:
* **British:**  Supported by colonial militias (primarily from the thirteen colonies) and Native American allies (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy, initially).  Key figures include Generals Edward Braddock, Jeffrey Amherst, James Wolfe.
* **French:** Supported by Native American allies (e.g., Huron, Algonquin, Ottawa). Key figures include Marquis de Montcalm.

## What:
A major conflict between [[Great Britain]] and [[France]] (and their respective Native American allies) over control of North America.  The war involved fighting across multiple theaters including the [[Ohio]] River Valley, the Great Lakes region, and Canada. Key battles include:
* **Fort Necessity (1754):**  Early British defeat, highlighting colonial weakness.
* **Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759):** Decisive British victory in Quebec, leading to the eventual French surrender.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **British Victory and Territorial Gains:** [[Great Britain]] gained control of vast territories in North America, including Canada and the [[Ohio]] River Valley. This drastically altered the geopolitical landscape.
* **Increased British Debt:** The high cost of the war led to increased taxation of the American colonies, fueling resentment and contributing to the growing tensions that ultimately led to the American Revolution.
* **Shift in Native American Alliances:** The war significantly weakened French influence among Native American tribes, forcing many to re-evaluate their alliances and leading to increased conflict with the British.
* **[[Proclamation of 1763]:** Issued by the British to prevent further westward expansion by colonists and limit conflict with Native Americans, but this angered many colonists who felt entitled to the newly acquired land.
* **Seeds of Revolution:** The war created a sense of shared colonial identity, but also highlighted fundamental differences in interests between [[Great Britain]] and its American colonies regarding expansion, governance, and taxation.  The aftermath directly contributed to the growing revolutionary sentiment in the thirteen colonies.
