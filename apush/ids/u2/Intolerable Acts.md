## ID: Intolerable Acts

## When: 1774 (Specific Acts passed between March and June)

## Who:
* **British Parliament:**  Passed the acts.
* **Colonists in Massachusetts (primarily), and other colonies:**  The primary targets of the acts, who responded with boycotts, protests, and increased calls for independence.  King George III and his administration were also key players in driving the legislation.

## What:
A series of five acts passed by the British Parliament in response to the Boston Tea Party.  These acts included:
* **The Boston Port Act:** Closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the destroyed tea.
* **The Massachusetts Government Act:** Reduced the power of the Massachusetts colonial legislature and gave the governor more control.
* **The Administration of Justice Act:** Allowed British officials accused of crimes in the colonies to be tried in Britain or elsewhere, removing them from colonial jurisdiction.
* **The Quartering Act:** Required colonists to house British troops in their homes or provide suitable accommodations.
* **The Quebec Act:** Expanded the territory of Quebec and granted religious freedom to Catholics, which alarmed many colonists who feared the expansion of Catholicism in the colonies (though not directly punitive toward the 13 colonies).


## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Increased Colonial Unity:** The acts unified the colonies against British policies, leading to increased intercolonial communication and cooperation.
* **Fueled Revolutionary Sentiment:** The harsh measures intensified colonial resentment and resistance toward British rule, pushing many toward support for independence.
* **First Continental Congress:** The Intolerable Acts were a major catalyst for the convening of the First Continental Congress in 1774, where delegates from twelve colonies met to coordinate a response to British policies.
* **Shift toward Revolution:** The Acts marked a significant escalation in the conflict between Britain and its American colonies, moving the relationship definitively toward armed rebellion.
* **Symbolic of Tyranny:** The acts became a powerful symbol of British oppression and injustice, further fueling the narrative used by revolutionary leaders to rally support for independence.
