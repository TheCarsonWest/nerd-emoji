## ID: [[Olive Branch Petition]] 
## When: July 5, 1775

## Who:
* **Authors:** The Continental Congress
* **Addressee:** King George III of [[Great Britain]] 
## What: 
A formal document adopted by the Continental Congress expressing the colonists' continued loyalty to the British Crown while protesting against the actions of the British government.  It sought reconciliation and a peaceful resolution to the growing conflict.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Last Attempt at Reconciliation:**  The [[Olive Branch Petition]] represented a final, desperate attempt by the colonists to avoid all-out war with [[Great Britain]].
* **Rejection by the King:** King George III rejected the petition, viewing the colonists as rebels. This rejection solidified the colonists' resolve to fight for independence.
* **Escalation of Conflict:** The King's rejection effectively ended any hopes of a peaceful settlement, pushing the colonies closer to declaring independence.
* **Shift in Colonial Sentiment:** While initially aiming for reconciliation, the petition's rejection fueled the growing support for independence among many colonists.
* **Propaganda Value:** The petition served as a demonstration of the colonists' desire for peace, potentially swaying public opinion in Britain (though ultimately unsuccessful).
