## ID: King Philip's War

## When: 1675-1678

## Who:
* **Native Americans:**  Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, and other tribes led by Metacom (King Philip)
* **Colonists:**  English colonists of New England

## What: 
A bloody and devastating war between Native American tribes and English colonists in southern New England.  Triggered by colonial encroachment on Native American lands and escalating tensions, the war involved numerous raids, ambushes, and pitched battles.  The war ended with the defeat of the Native Americans and significant changes to the power dynamics of the region.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Devastating Casualties:** The war resulted in a disproportionately high death toll among the Native American population, significantly weakening their power and influence in New England.  A large percentage of the colonial population was also killed or displaced.
* **Shift in Power:** The war solidified English colonial dominance in New England, leading to further expansion and dispossession of Native American lands.
* **Impact on Colonial Attitudes:** The brutality of the war fostered increased fear and distrust between colonists and Native Americans, shaping colonial attitudes toward indigenous populations for generations.
* **Metacom's Legacy:** Metacom, despite his defeat, became a symbol of Native American resistance against colonial encroachment.
* **Long-Term Consequences:** The war's impact profoundly altered the demographic and political landscape of New England, paving the way for further colonial expansion and the decline of Native American power.
