## ID: [[Boston Tea Party]] 
## When: December 16, 1773

## Who:
* **[[Sons of Liberty]]:**  A group of American colonists who organized and participated in the event.  Key figures included [[Samuel Adams]], but many others participated.
* **British East India Company:** The target of the protest, whose tea monopoly was the issue.
* **British Authorities:**  Initially, they were largely passive observers though later responded with the [[Intolerable Acts]].


## What:
A political protest by the [[Sons of Liberty]] in Boston, [[Massachusetts]], where colonists disguised as Mohawk Indians boarded three British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor to protest the [[Tea Act]].

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Escalation of Tensions:** The [[Boston Tea Party]] significantly escalated tensions between [[Great Britain]] and the American colonies. It was a bold act of defiance that directly challenged British authority.
* **[[Intolerable Acts]]:** The British government responded with the [[Intolerable Acts]] (also known as the Coercive Acts), a series of punitive measures designed to punish [[Massachusetts]] and assert British control.  These acts further inflamed colonial resentment.
* **Movement Towards Revolution:** The event marked a crucial step toward the American Revolution. It demonstrated the growing colonial resistance to British policies and contributed to the growing sentiment for independence.
* **Propaganda and Symbolism:** The [[Boston Tea Party]] became a powerful symbol of colonial resistance and was widely publicized throughout the colonies, fostering unity among the colonists.
* **Taxation Without Representation:** The event highlighted the colonists' central grievance: taxation without representation. The [[Tea Act]], while seemingly beneficial on the surface, was viewed as an attempt to undermine colonial merchants and force acceptance of taxation without colonial consent.
