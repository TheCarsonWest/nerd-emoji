## ID: Bacon's Rebellion

## When: 1676

## Who:
* **Nathaniel Bacon:**  Leader of the rebellion, a wealthy planter.
* **Governor William Berkeley:** Governor of Virginia.
* **Indentured Servants:**  A significant portion of the rebellion's participants.
* **African Slaves:**  A small number participated, though their roles are debated.
* **Planters:**  The wealthy elite who were targeted by the rebellion.


## What: 
An armed rebellion in the Virginia Colony led by Nathaniel Bacon against Governor William Berkeley.  The rebellion was fueled by tensions between wealthy planters and the increasingly impoverished populace (many of whom were former indentured servants) who were angered by Berkeley's policies, particularly his failure to protect them from Native American raids and his favoritism towards the wealthy planter class. Bacon's forces burned Jamestown and challenged Berkeley's authority before Bacon's unexpected death ended the rebellion.


## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Shift towards Slavery:** Following the rebellion, Virginia's elite increasingly turned to enslaved Africans as a labor source, as they were less likely to rebel and demand land ownership than indentured servants. This marked a significant shift in the colony's social and economic structure.
* **Increased Racial Tensions:**  The rebellion exposed underlying social tensions in the colony and contributed to increased racial tensions, leading to a harsher system of racial slavery.
* **Challenging Colonial Authority:** Bacon's Rebellion demonstrated the fragility of colonial authority and the potential for popular unrest to challenge the established political order.
* **Development of a more structured colonial government:** In response to the rebellion, the Virginia government became more centralized and efficient to prevent future uprisings.
* **Long-term impact on labor systems in the colonies:** The rebellion demonstrated the inherent instability of the system of indentured servitude and paved the way for the rise of chattel slavery.
