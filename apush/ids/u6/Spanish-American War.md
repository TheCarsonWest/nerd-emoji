## ID: [[Spanish-American War]]

## When: April 21, 1898 â€“ August 13, 1898

## Who:
* **[[United States]]:** President [[William McKinley]], Admiral George Dewey, Commodore Winfield Scott Schley, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (Rough Riders)
* **[[Spain]]:**  Spanish military forces in Cuba and the Philippines

## What:
A brief war between the [[United States]] and [[Spain]], sparked by the sinking of the USS [[Maine]] in Havana harbor (though the cause remains debated) and fueled by American public outcry over Spanish atrocities in Cuba and a desire for imperial expansion.  Key battles included the Battle of Manila Bay (Philippines) and the Battle of San Juan Hill (Cuba).  The war resulted in a decisive US victory.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Acquisition of Overseas Territories:** The US gained control of Cuba (though it remained nominally independent), Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, marking the beginning of its emergence as a major imperial power. This dramatically shifted US foreign policy and its role in global affairs.
* **Rise of American Imperialism:** The war cemented a shift in American foreign policy toward imperialism, driven by economic interests, strategic considerations, and a sense of racial and cultural superiority.
* **Increased Military Strength:** The war demonstrated the growing power of the US military and its capacity for projecting power overseas.
* **[[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s Rise to Prominence:**  Roosevelt's leadership of the Rough Riders during the war catapulted him to national fame and paved the way for his future presidency.
* **Debate over Imperialism:** The war ignited a significant debate within the US over the morality and implications of imperialism, fueling anti-imperialist movements.
* **[[Platt Amendment]]:** This amendment, imposed on Cuba as a condition of its independence, gave the US significant influence over Cuban affairs, demonstrating the limitations of Cuban sovereignty.  
* **Philippine-American War:**  The US victory in the [[Spanish-American War]] led directly to the prolonged and brutal Philippine-American War (1899-1902), further highlighting the complexities and costs of American imperialism.
