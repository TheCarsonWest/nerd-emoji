## ID: [[Triple Alliance]] (1882)

## When: May 20, 1882

## Who: 
* **Germany:** Otto von Bismarck (Chancellor)
* **Austria-Hungary:**  Emperor Franz Joseph I
* **Italy:**  King Umberto I


## What: 
A military alliance formed between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.  The agreement obligated each member to support the others militarily if attacked by another power.  This was a defensive alliance, meant to deter potential aggressors.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **European Power Balance:** The [[Triple Alliance]] significantly altered the balance of power in Europe, creating a major bloc that countered the growing influence of other nations (like [[France]] and Russia).  It contributed to a climate of increased tension and suspicion among European powers.
* **World War I Precursor:** The alliance system, including the [[Triple Alliance]], is often cited as a significant factor in the outbreak of World War I.  The complex web of alliances meant that a conflict between two nations could easily escalate into a much larger war.  Specifically, Austria-Hungaryâ€™s declaration of war on Serbia in 1914 triggered the alliance system, pulling in Germany (and thus Italy initially, though they eventually switched sides) and other nations.
* **Italian Ambivalence:** Italy's membership in the [[Triple Alliance]] was somewhat tenuous.  Italy's participation in the [[Triple Alliance]] was more opportunistic than driven by genuine ideological alignment. Their later switch to the Allied side in WWI demonstrates this.
* **Shifting Alliances:** The [[Triple Alliance]] demonstrated the ever-changing nature of international relations and the importance of military alliances in shaping foreign policy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
