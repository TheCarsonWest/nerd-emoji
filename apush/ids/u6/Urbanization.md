## ID: [[Urbanization]] in the [[Gilded Age]] and Progressive Era

## When: 1890s-1920s

## Who: 
* **Immigrants:**  Large influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe.
* **Industrialists:**  Figures like [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D]]. Rockefeller, whose industries fueled urban growth.
* **Progressive reformers:**  Individuals and organizations advocating for urban improvements and social justice (e.g., Jane Addams, Jacob Riis).
* **City bosses/political machines:**  Controlled urban politics and services, often through corruption.


## What: 
Rapid growth of cities due to industrialization and immigration.  This led to overcrowding, tenement housing, sanitation problems, increased crime, and the development of distinct ethnic enclaves.  Progressive Era reforms attempted to address these issues through various initiatives like settlement houses, public health campaigns, and political reforms aimed at reducing corruption.


## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Social and Economic Change:** Transformed the social and economic landscape of the US, creating a new urban working class and fostering a distinct urban culture.
* **Rise of [[Progressivism]]:** The problems associated with urbanization spurred the Progressive movement, which aimed to reform society and address urban ills.
* **[[Political Machines]] and Corruption:** The rapid growth created opportunities for political corruption and the rise of powerful political machines that controlled city governments.
* **Cultural Diversity and Conflict:** The influx of immigrants led to increased cultural diversity but also resulted in ethnic tensions and discrimination.
* **Technological Advancements:** [[Urbanization]] spurred technological innovations in transportation (subways, streetcars), sanitation, and building construction.
* **Shift in Demographics:**  A dramatic shift in the population from rural areas to urban centers, fundamentally altering the American identity.  This impacted voting patterns and political power significantly.
