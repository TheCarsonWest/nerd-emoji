## ID: [[Allied Powers]]' Entry into WWI

## When: September 5, 1914 (and ongoing)

## Who:
* **[[Allied Powers]]:** Primarily [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and Russia (later joined by the [[United States]], Italy, Japan, and others).
* **[[Central Powers]]:** Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria

## What: 
Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914, a series of alliances triggered a rapid escalation into a large-scale European conflict. By September 5th, 1914,  the [[Allied Powers]] (primarily [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and Russia) were formally at war with the [[Central Powers]] (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and their allies).  This marked the beginning of the major phase of fighting in World War I.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Global Conflict:** The involvement of the [[Allied Powers]] transformed a European conflict into a global war, drawing in nations across continents.
* **American Neutrality (Initially):** The US initially declared neutrality, but increasing German aggression (unrestricted submarine warfare, [[Zimmerman Telegram]]) eventually led to US entry in 1917.
* **Shift in Global Power:** WWI dramatically reshaped the global balance of power, leading to the decline of European empires and the rise of the [[United States]] as a major global power.
* **Economic Impact:** The war had a profound impact on the American economy, boosting industrial production, and accelerating the transition to a mass-production economy.
* **Social Change:** The war significantly impacted American society, spurring social and political reforms, but also fueling anxieties about social unrest and radicalism ([[Red Scare]]).
* **[[Treaty of Versailles]] & [[League of Nations]]:** The eventual Allied victory shaped the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which imposed harsh terms on Germany and led to the creation of the [[League of Nations]] (although the US did not join). The consequences of the treaty contributed to the rise of extremist ideologies and ultimately to WWII.
