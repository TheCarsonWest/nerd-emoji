## ID: Formation of the [[Triple Entente]]

## When:  May 20, 1882 (Formalized the existing alliances)

## Who:
* **[[France]]:**  Second French Republic
* **Russia:** Russian Empire
* **[[Great Britain]]:** United Kingdom

## What: 
The [[Triple Entente]] wasn't a formal treaty like the [[Triple Alliance]], but rather a series of agreements and understandings between [[France]], Russia, and [[Great Britain]], that solidified existing bilateral alliances.  It wasn't a single event, but a gradual process of growing cooperation in response to the perceived threat posed by the [[Triple Alliance]] (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy).  These agreements involved military and diplomatic cooperation.


## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Counterbalance to the [[Triple Alliance]]:** The Entente created a powerful counterweight to the [[Triple Alliance]], significantly increasing international tensions and contributing to the complex web of alliances that led to World War I.
* **Shifting Alliances:** The formation of the Entente reflected the changing geopolitical landscape of Europe and the growing rivalry between [[Great Britain]] and Germany.
* **World War I:** The pre-existing alliances and mutual defense pacts within both the [[Triple Entente]] and [[Triple Alliance]] meant that a localized conflict (such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand) could rapidly escalate into a global war. The Entente's commitment to mutual defense ultimately drew them into World War I.
* **Limited Formalization:**  Unlike the [[Triple Alliance]], its less formal nature allowed for some flexibility, but also meant that the level of commitment among the Entente powers was less explicitly defined. This ambiguity sometimes proved problematic.
