## ID: Sinking of the Lusitania

## When: May 7, 1915

## Who:
* **Victim:** Passengers and crew of the British passenger liner *Lusitania* (including 128 Americans)
* **Attacker:** German U-boat (Unterseeboot) U-20

## What: 
A German U-boat torpedoed the British ocean liner *Lusitania* off the coast of Ireland. The *Lusitania* was carrying both passengers and munitions (a fact that the Germans used to justify the attack). The sinking resulted in a large loss of life, including many American citizens.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Increased Anti-German Sentiment in the U.S.:** The sinking galvanized public opinion in the United States against Germany.  The loss of American lives fueled calls for war.
* **Strained U.S.-German Relations:** The incident significantly worsened relations between the United States and Germany, pushing the U.S. closer to entering World War I.
* **Wilson's Response:** President Woodrow Wilson initially protested the attack and demanded that Germany cease unrestricted submarine warfare.  While he pursued diplomatic solutions for a time, the sinking ultimately contributed to the U.S. declaration of war in 1917.
* **Propaganda:** The event was heavily used as propaganda by the Allied powers to sway public opinion against Germany.
* **Shift in Public Opinion:** Though initially leaning towards neutrality, the sinking swayed a significant portion of the American public towards intervention in the war.  This shift in public opinion became a key factor influencing the government's eventual decision to join the conflict.
