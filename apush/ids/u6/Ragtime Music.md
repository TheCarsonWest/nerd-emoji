It was popular in sheet music and played on pianos in saloons, dance halls, and eventually concert halls.

* **Bridging Musical Styles:** Ragtime blended European musical traditions (classical influences) with African American musical traditions (rhythms and improvisation), foreshadowing the development of jazz.
* **Cultural Impact:** Ragtime was a significant form of musical expression for African Americans during a time of racial segregation, giving them a platform for artistic creation and cultural identity. It also reflected the social changes and energy of the era.
* **[[Popular Culture]]:** It achieved widespread popularity across racial lines, demonstrating the power of music to transcend social boundaries (though racial segregation still greatly limited the opportunities for Black performers and composers).
* **Influence on Later Genres:** Its rhythmic innovations heavily influenced jazz, blues, and other popular music genres that followed. It helped pave the way for the evolution of American popular music in the 20th century.
* **Technological influence:** The rise of player pianos and sheet music aided in Ragtime's popularity and distribution.
