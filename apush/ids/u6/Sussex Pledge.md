## ID: [[Sussex Pledge]]

## When: May 4, 1916

## Who: 
* **Germany:**  German government
* **[[United States]]:**  President [[Woodrow Wilson]]

## What: 
A promise made by the German government to the [[United States]] that German U-boats would not sink merchant ships without warning.  This followed the sinking of the British passenger liner, the *Sussex*, by a German U-boat, which resulted in American casualties.  The pledge included a commitment to only attack enemy merchant vessels that attempted to flee or resist.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Averted War (Temporarily):** The [[Sussex Pledge]] temporarily eased tensions between the [[United States]] and Germany, averting immediate war.  It bought Wilson time to pursue his policy of neutrality.
* **Demonstrated German Reluctance:** While the pledge was seen as a diplomatic victory for the US, it also demonstrated Germany's reluctance to fully abandon unrestricted submarine warfare, a policy that would later be resumed, ultimately pushing the US into World War I.
* **Short-lived Agreement:** The pledge proved to be short-lived.  Germany, under pressure from its military leadership, eventually resumed unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, leading to the [[Zimmerman Telegram]] incident and ultimately the declaration of war by the [[United States]] against Germany.
* **Public Opinion:** While the Pledge initially appeased many Americans, growing anti-German sentiment continued to increase as a result of continued German aggression.
