## ID: W.E.B. Du Bois's Thought & Activism (Late 1890s Onward)

## When: Late 1890s - 1960s (Focus on late 1890s for this notecard)

## Who: W.E.B. Du Bois –  African American scholar, sociologist, historian, and civil rights activist.

## What:  
In the late 1890s, Du Bois began articulating his ideas on race and social justice, most famously in his seminal work *The [[Philadelphia]] Negro* (1899), a pioneering study of Black life in urban America. This marked the beginning of his lifelong commitment to challenging racial inequality through scholarship and activism.  He was a founding member of the NAACP and advocated for the "Talented Tenth," believing that highly educated African Americans should lead the fight for racial equality.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Pioneering Sociological Work:** *The [[Philadelphia]] Negro* established Du Bois as a leading figure in sociology and provided a crucial empirical foundation for understanding the social conditions affecting African Americans.
* **Challenging Racial Ideology:**  Du Bois directly challenged dominant racial ideologies that justified segregation and discrimination, exposing their inherent flaws through rigorous research and passionate advocacy.
* **NAACP Founding Member & Influence:** His involvement in the NAACP provided a crucial intellectual and organizational foundation for the civil rights movement.  His concept of "double consciousness" – the internal conflict experienced by African Americans due to their simultaneous identification as both American and Black – profoundly shaped understandings of racial identity and the Black experience.
* **Influence on Civil Rights Strategy:** Du Bois's advocacy for political action and integration profoundly influenced the strategies adopted by later civil rights leaders. His ideas helped shape the goals and methods of the movement for decades to come.
* **Long-lasting intellectual legacy:** Du Bois's writings continue to be studied and debated today, offering invaluable insight into the complexities of race, class, and power in American society.
