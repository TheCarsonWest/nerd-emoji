## ID: The Square Deal (May 18, 1902)

## WHEN:  May 18, 1902 (and generally encompassing Theodore Roosevelt's presidency, 1901-1909)

## WHO: Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States; Coal Miners' Union; Coal Mine Owners

## WHAT:  The Square Deal was not a single event but rather President Theodore Roosevelt's domestic program aimed at fairness for all Americans.  In May 1902, a key component of this was his intervention in the Great Coal Strike, threatening to use federal troops to seize the mines unless both sides agreed to arbitration.

## IMPACT: Why Significant?:
* **Government Intervention in Labor Disputes:**  Roosevelt's intervention marked a significant shift in the federal government's role, demonstrating a willingness to mediate between labor and capital, rather than simply siding with business interests (as had been the common practice).
* **Arbitration as a Tool:**  The successful arbitration of the coal strike established arbitration as a legitimate means of resolving labor disputes, a precedent used in later conflicts.
* **Public Support for Roosevelt:** Roosevelt's action significantly boosted his popularity, portraying him as a champion of the "common man" and someone who could stand up to powerful corporations. This contributed to his re-election in 1904 and strengthened the Progressive movement.
* **Foundation for Trust-Busting:** The Square Deal laid the groundwork for Roosevelt's later trust-busting efforts, as he aimed to curb the power of monopolies and create a fairer economic playing field.  It demonstrated his belief in regulating big business for the benefit of society.
* **Increased Presidential Power:** Roosevelt's actions expanded the power and influence of the presidency in domestic affairs, establishing a precedent for future presidents to intervene in economic and social issues.
