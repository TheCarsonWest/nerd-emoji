* **Racial Superiority:** The poem's central theme was the idea of white racial superiority and the supposed inability of non-white peoples to govern themselves. This contributed to racist attitudes and policies throughout the early 20th century.
* **Anti-Imperialist Opposition:**  While supporting the cause of expansionists, it also fueled the anti-imperialist movement in the US.  Critics attacked the poem's racist assumptions and the exploitative nature of imperialism.
* **Shaped Public Opinion:** The poem's widespread dissemination significantly shaped public opinion about America's role in the world, influencing how the American public perceived the acquisition of overseas territories.
* **Lasting Legacy:** The phrase "White Man's Burden" continues to be used to describe the justification of colonialism and other forms of imperialism, highlighting the negative legacy of such ideologies.  It serves as a reminder of the harmful effects of racial prejudice and the exploitative nature of empire-building.
