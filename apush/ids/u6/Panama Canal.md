## ID: [[Panama Canal]] Opening

## When: August 15, 1914

## Who:
* **President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]:**  Instrumental in initiating and overseeing the construction of the canal.
* **John Stevens:** Chief Engineer of the [[Panama Canal]] project (early stages).
* **George Goethals:** Chief Engineer of the [[Panama Canal]] project (during major construction & completion).
* **Panamanians:**  Thousands of Panamanians, along with workers from various other countries, labored on the canal's construction.

## What: 
The completion and opening of the [[Panama Canal]], a waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the Isthmus of Panama.  This drastically reduced travel time and distance for ships traversing between the two oceans.  The US gained control of the Canal Zone.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Enhanced US Trade and Military Power:** The canal significantly shortened shipping routes, boosting American commerce and giving the US Navy a strategic advantage in both oceans. This enhanced both their power projection and economic influence globally.
* **Global Trade:**  Facilitated faster and cheaper international trade, impacting global commerce and economic interconnectedness.
* **Economic Impact on Panama:**  While the US gained control, the Canal's construction and subsequent operation brought economic development (albeit unevenly distributed) to Panama, albeit often under US dominance.
* **US Foreign Policy:** Demonstrated America's growing influence and power on the world stage, reflecting a more assertive foreign policy under the Roosevelt Corollary.
* **Geopolitical Implications:** The canal strengthened the US position in Latin America, solidifying the country's growing influence in the region and causing resentment amongst other countries and fueling anti-American sentiment.
* **Public Health Advances:** The canal's construction represented a significant undertaking in public health management, as efforts to control diseases like yellow fever and malaria were crucial to its success. This advanced scientific understanding and public health practices.
