## ID: [[Fourteen Points]]

## When: January 8, 1919

## Who: President [[Woodrow Wilson]]

## What:  A speech delivered by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to a joint session of Congress outlining his vision for a postwar world.  The [[Fourteen Points]] proposed a series of principles to prevent future wars, including open diplomacy, freedom of the seas, arms reductions, self-determination for nationalities, and the creation of a [[League of Nations]].

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Post-WWI Peace Efforts:**  The [[Fourteen Points]] formed the basis for the Allied peace negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference. While not all points were fully adopted, they significantly influenced the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the creation of the [[League of Nations]].
* **Self-Determination:** The principle of self-determination for nationalities inspired nationalist movements around the world and influenced the redrawing of national boundaries in Europe.
* **[[League of Nations]]:** The proposed [[League of Nations]], though ultimately flawed, represented a novel attempt at international cooperation and collective security, paving the way for future international organizations like the United Nations.
* **US Senate Rejection:**  The US Senate ultimately rejected the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (including the [[League of Nations]]) due to concerns about American sovereignty and involvement in international affairs. This rejection significantly impacted the US's role in the post-war world and contributed to the rise of isolationism.
* **Idealism vs. Reality:** The [[Fourteen Points]] demonstrated Wilson's idealistic vision for a peaceful and just world order, but it also highlighted the difficulties in translating such ideals into practical policy in the face of competing national interests and power struggles.
