## ID: Election of 1912

## When: November 5, 1912

## Who:
* **William Howard Taft:** Republican incumbent President.
* **Theodore Roosevelt:** Progressive "Bull Moose" Party candidate; former President.
* **Woodrow Wilson:** Democratic candidate; Governor of New Jersey.
* **Eugene V. Debs:** Socialist Party candidate.

## What:  A four-way presidential election considered one of the most significant in American history.  The split in the Republican party between Taft and Roosevelt allowed Wilson to win a decisive victory.  Each candidate represented a distinct ideology: Taft represented conservative Republicans, Roosevelt represented progressive Republicans, Wilson represented the progressive Democrats, and Debs represented the Socialist movement.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Progressive Era's Influence:** The election highlighted the growing power of the progressive movement and its impact on American politics. The Progressive platform of Roosevelt and Wilson dominated the discussion.
* **End of Republican Dominance:** The split in the Republican party marked the end of their era of dominance and ushered in the Progressive Era under Wilson.
* **Wilson's Presidency:** Wilson's victory led to the implementation of his progressive agenda, including the Underwood Tariff Act, the Federal Reserve Act, and the Clayton Antitrust Act.  His presidency, significantly shaped by this win, profoundly impacted American society and the economy.
* **Third-Party Influence:** Debs's relatively strong showing demonstrated the growing support for socialist ideas and the potential for third-party movements to influence national politics.
* **Shift in Political Landscape:** The election fundamentally reshaped the American political landscape, setting the stage for the progressive reforms that would characterize the next decade and influence the country's development leading up to and during WWI.
