## ID: "Bull Moose" Party (Progressive Party) of 1912

## When: 1912 (Formed during the 1912 Presidential Election)

## Who: 
* **[[Theodore Roosevelt]]:**  Former President, leading figure of the Progressive movement.  
* **Other Progressives:**  Dissatisfied [[Republicans]] who supported Roosevelt's progressive platform.

## What: 
The Progressive Party, nicknamed the "[[Bull Moose Party]]," was formed by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] after he lost the Republican nomination to [[William Howard Taft]].  Roosevelt, believing Taft had betrayed progressive principles, launched a third-party candidacy aiming to advance a platform focused on stronger government regulation of business, women's suffrage, and social welfare programs.  

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Split the Republican Vote:**  The "Bull Moose" candidacy directly contributed to [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s victory in the 1912 election.  By splitting the Republican vote, Roosevelt ensured neither Taft nor he could win.  
* **Increased Awareness of Progressive Issues:** The party's platform significantly raised public awareness of progressive ideals, influencing future political agendas and legislation.  Many of Roosevelt's proposals, though not immediately enacted, would later become part of the political landscape.
* **Short-lived but Influential:** Though the party itself was short-lived, it demonstrated the strength of the Progressive movement and its ability to mobilize support outside the established political parties. It helped push the major parties towards adopting many of the Progressive's reforms.
* **Long-term impact on the political landscape:** The "Bull Moose" platform previewed many policies and reforms that would be enacted in the decades to come, signaling a shift towards stronger government regulation and social welfare programs.
