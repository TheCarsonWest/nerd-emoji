## ID: Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (Start of WWI)

## When: June 28, 1914

## Who:
* **Archduke Franz Ferdinand:** Heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.
* **Gavrilo Princip:**  A member of the Black Hand, a Serbian nationalist group.

## What: Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, were assassinated in Sarajevo, Bosnia (then part of Austria-Hungary) by Gavrilo Princip. This act of political terrorism triggered a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Spark of WWI:** The assassination served as the immediate catalyst for the outbreak of World War I. Austria-Hungary, blaming Serbia, issued an ultimatum that Serbia could not reasonably accept, leading to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia.
* **Alliance System:** The complex system of alliances between European powers (the [[Triple Entente]] – Britain, [[France]], Russia; and the [[Triple Alliance]] – Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy) drew nations into the conflict, escalating a localized crisis into a global war.
* **Shift in Global Power:** WWI dramatically reshaped the global political landscape, leading to the collapse of empires (Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian, German) and the rise of new nations.  The war also spurred significant social and political changes, including women's suffrage movements and advancements in technology.
* **US Entry into WWI:** While not directly causing US entry, the war’s escalation and the unrestricted submarine warfare conducted by Germany ultimately led the [[United States]] to declare war on Germany in 1917.
* **Long-Term Consequences:** The war's devastating impact on Europe contributed to the rise of fascism and [[Nazism]] and set the stage for World War II.  The [[apush/ids/u6/[[Treaty of Versailles]], designed to prevent future conflicts, instead sowed the seeds of resentment and instability, ultimately failing to achieve its goals.
