## ID: Tenement Housing

## When: Late 19th and early 20th centuries (focus on conditions around April 12, 1901 as a representative point)

## Who: 
* **Immigrants and Low-Income Workers:** Primarily the residents of tenement buildings.
* **Landlords:** Often prioritized profit over living conditions.
* **Reformers:**  Jacob Riis (photographer and journalist) documented the conditions, influencing public awareness and reform efforts.  Others like Jane Addams (Hull House) worked directly to improve lives in these communities.

## What: 
Overcrowded, unsanitary, and dangerous multi-family dwellings prevalent in rapidly growing urban areas.  Conditions included inadequate ventilation, lighting, sanitation (shared toilets, lack of running water), fire hazards, and disease spread. April 12th, 1901 serves as a representative date; the conditions were ongoing and widespread at this time.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Public Health Crisis:** High rates of disease and mortality among tenement residents due to unsanitary living conditions.
* **Social Problems:** Poverty, crime, and social unrest linked to overcrowding and poor living conditions.
* **Progressive Reform:** Jacob Riis's photography ("How the Other Half Lives") and other investigative journalism brought the issue to public attention, fueling the Progressive Era's reform efforts aimed at improving housing conditions.
* **Tenement Reform Laws:**  New York and other cities passed legislation mandating minimum standards for tenement construction and occupancy, including improved sanitation, ventilation, and fire safety. This represents a step toward improved public health and welfare.
* **Urban Planning:** The problems of tenement housing contributed to the growing movement for urban planning and reform, pushing for improved infrastructure, public services, and better living standards in cities.
