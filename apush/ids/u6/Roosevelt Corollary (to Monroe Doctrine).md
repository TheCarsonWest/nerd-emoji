## ID: Roosevelt Corollary to the [[Monroe Doctrine]]

## When: December [[6]], 1904

## Who:  President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]

## What:  
An addition to the [[Monroe Doctrine]] (1823), asserting that the [[United States]] had the right to intervene in the domestic affairs of Latin American nations to maintain stability and prevent European intervention.  It essentially claimed the US had a police power in the Western Hemisphere.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Increased US Intervention in Latin America:** The Roosevelt Corollary justified numerous US military interventions in Latin American countries throughout the early 20th century, often to protect American economic interests (e.g., collecting debts owed to US businesses). This led to resentment and instability in the region.
* **Expansion of US Influence:**  The corollary solidified US dominance in the Western Hemisphere, furthering the nation's imperial ambitions.
* **Big Stick Diplomacy:** The corollary exemplifies Roosevelt's "Big Stick" diplomacyâ€”a policy of using military force to achieve US foreign policy goals.
* **Negative Relations with Latin America:** The Corollary fostered negative relations between the US and many Latin American nations, creating lasting resentment and distrust.
* **Precedent for Future Interventions:** The Roosevelt Corollary set a dangerous precedent for US interventionism in other regions of the world in later decades.
