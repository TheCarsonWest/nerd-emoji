* **John Marshall:** Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who presided over the case.

## What:

* **Contributed to the Trail of Tears:**  [[Georgia]]'s defiance of the court's ruling contributed to the forced removal of the Cherokee Nation from their lands, a traumatic event known as the Trail of Tears.
* **Highlighting federal-state conflict:** The case further revealed the tension between the federal government's authority over Native American affairs and the states' desire to control land and resources.
