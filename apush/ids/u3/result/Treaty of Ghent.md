# ID: [[Treaty of Ghent]] 

## WHEN: December 24, 1814

## WHO: 
* **[[United States]]** represented by [[John Quincy Adams]], Henry Clay, and Albert Gallatin.
* **[[Great Britain]]** 

## WHAT:
The [[Treaty of Ghent]] was signed in Ghent, Belgium, ending the [[War of 1812]]. 

## IMPACT? Why Significant?: 
* **Return to Status Quo Ante Bellum:**  The treaty essentially restored pre-war boundaries and did not address the original causes of the conflict, such as impressment or neutral trading rights.
* **Preserved American Independence:** Despite not achieving all of its war aims, the treaty solidified the [[United States]]' independence and prevented British attempts to reclaim territory. 
* **Fueled Nationalism:** The war's outcome, despite the treaty's terms, fostered a sense of American national pride and unity, contributing to the [[Era of Good Feelings]]. 
* **Shifted Focus Westward:** With the British threat in the east diminished, the [[United States]] was free to expand westward, leading to increased conflict with Native American tribes.
