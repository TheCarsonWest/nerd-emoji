## ID: [[Report on Manufactures]] 
## When: December [[5]], 1791

## Who: 
- **Authored by:** [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first Secretary of the Treasury

## What:
A proposal made by Hamilton to Congress outlining a plan for government-assisted economic development focused on promoting manufacturing in the [[United States]]. 

Key recommendations included:

* **Protective tariffs:**  To shield young American industries from foreign competition.
* **Government subsidies:**  Financial assistance for new industries.
* **Investment in infrastructure:**  Improvements to transportation, like roads and canals, to facilitate trade and resource movement. 
* **Promotion of innovation:**  Support for inventions and technological advancements.

## Impact? Why Significant?:

* **Laid the groundwork for [[The American System]]:**  Though not fully implemented at the time, the ideas within the report heavily influenced later economic policies, particularly Henry Clay's "American System" in the early 19th century.
* **Sparked debate about the role of government in the economy:** The [[Report on Manufactures]] ignited a fierce debate between Federalists (like Hamilton), who favored a strong, interventionist government in economic affairs, and Democratic-[[Republicans]] (like [[Thomas Jefferson]]), who preferred a more laissez-faire approach.
* **Contributed to the rise of industrialization:** While not immediately transformative, the report's ideas laid the foundation for the eventual growth of American manufacturing and contributed to the nation's shift from an agrarian to an industrial economy.
* **Long-term impact:** The debate over tariffs, government support for industry, and infrastructure development continues to resonate in American political and economic discourse today.
