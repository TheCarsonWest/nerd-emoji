# ID: [[Virginia]] and [[Kentucky]] Resolutions 
## When: 1798-1799
## Who: 
- **Authored by:** [[Thomas Jefferson]] ([[Kentucky]] Resolution) and [[James Madison]] ([[Virginia]] Resolution)
- **Adopted by:**  [[Kentucky]] and [[Virginia]] state legislatures 

## What:
- Resolutions written in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts passed by the Federalist-controlled Congress and President [[John Adams]].  
- Argued that the states had the right to declare federal laws unconstitutional, specifically citing the Tenth Amendment and the idea of "compact theory" (that states retained individual sovereignty).
- The [[Kentucky]] Resolution (in a more radical statement later added by Jefferson) even suggested the idea of "[[Nullification]]" -  that a state could void federal laws it deemed unconstitutional. 

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
- **States' Rights:**  Laid the groundwork for future arguments about states' rights and became a foundational document for the [[Nullification]] crisis in the 1830s and, eventually, the Southern secession movement leading to the [[Civil War]]. 
- **Political Theory:**  Introduced important concepts about the relationship between the federal government and the states, sparking a debate that continues today. 
- **Limited Impact at the Time:** While important in the long term, the resolutions failed to overturn the Alien and Sedition Acts, as no other states adopted them.
