## What: 
The [[Election of 1824]] was the first contested presidential election in US history, featuring four prominent candidates from the Democratic-Republican Party. Jackson received the most popular votes and electoral votes but failed to secure a majority. As a result, the election was decided in the House of Representatives, where Henry Clay threw his support behind [[John Quincy Adams]], who subsequently won the presidency.

## Impact: Why Significant?

* **Rise of Jacksonian Democracy:** Jackson's strong popular support, despite the loss, propelled him to national prominence and laid the groundwork for his successful run in the 1828 election. This also marked the beginning of the "Second Party System" and the rise of mass democracy in the US.
* **"Corrupt Bargain" Controversy:** Jackson's supporters accused Adams and Clay of a "corrupt bargain," claiming Clay had swayed the House vote in exchange for a position in Adams' administration. This controversy fueled Jackson's future political campaigns and helped define the political landscape for years to come.
* **Shift in Power Dynamics:** The election highlighted the increasing importance of popular support and the potential for future conflicts between the executive and legislative branches of government. It also set a precedent for contested elections and the potential for power shifts within the party system.
