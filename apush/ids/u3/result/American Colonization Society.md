- **Prominent members:** Henry Clay (Speaker of the House), John Randolph (Senator), Richard Bland Lee (Congressman and future US Attorney General), Francis Scott Key (lawyer and author of "The Star-Spangled Banner")
- **Important to Note:**  While some members genuinely supported the idea of freeing enslaved people, many prominent members were slaveholders who viewed the Society as a way to remove free Black people from the US and maintain the institution of slavery. 

## What: 
A group that aimed to relocate free Black Americans to the continent of Africa. It led to the founding of the colony of Liberia in 1822 as a location for resettlement. 

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
* **Heightened tensions over slavery:** The Society's activities fueled debate over slavery, with abolitionists condemning it as a racist attempt to remove Black people from a nation built on their labor, while supporters defended it as a benevolent solution to racial tensions and a way to gradually end slavery. 
* **Contributed to Black American emigration:**  While many Black Americans opposed the Society's goals, some chose to emigrate to Liberia, seeking greater freedom and opportunity. 
* **Had lasting impact:** Liberia's existence as a nation today is a direct result of the American Colonization Society's actions. 
* **Reflected complexities of the period:** The Society represents the complex and often contradictory attitudes towards race and slavery in the antebellum [[United States]].
