# ID: [[Embargo Act of 1807]] ## When: December 22, 1807
## Who: 
* **Proposed by:** President [[Thomas Jefferson]]
* **Passed by:** U.S. Congress
## What: 
An act that prohibited American ships from sailing to any foreign port. This was in response to the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, where a British ship attacked an American ship and impressed American sailors into the British Navy.  Jefferson hoped the embargo would pressure Britain and [[France]] (who were at war) to respect American neutrality and stop impressing American sailors. 
## Impact? Why Significant?: 
* **Devastated the U.S. economy:** Severely hurt American shipping and agriculture, especially in New England, leading to widespread economic hardship and smuggling.
* **Politically damaging to Jefferson:** Eroded support for the Democratic-Republican Party, particularly in the Northeast. 
* **Contributed to the [[War of 1812]]:** Heightened tensions with Britain, eventually contributing to the outbreak of war in 1812.
* **Demonstrated the limits of peaceful coercion:** Showed that economic pressure alone was insufficient to protect American interests on the high seas.
* **Spurred domestic industrial growth:** Forced the U.S. to become more self-sufficient by encouraging the growth of domestic manufacturing, though on a limited scale.
