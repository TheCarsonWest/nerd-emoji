# ID: [[Panic of 1819]] ## When: 1819 (economic downturn lasting until about 1821)
## Who: 
- **Affected:** Farmers, land speculators, banks, and average citizens across the [[United States]]. 
- **Key Figures:** President [[James Monroe]] (his policies indirectly contributed to the Panic)
## What: 
The first major financial crisis in the [[United States]], characterized by widespread bank failures, foreclosures, unemployment, and a sharp economic downturn. 
- **Causes:** 
    - Overspeculation in Western land fueled by easy credit from state banks.
    - A decline in European demand for American agricultural goods (especially cotton) after the Napoleonic Wars ended.
    - The Second Bank of the [[United States]] tightened credit policies to control inflation, leading to loan defaults.
## Impact? Why Significant?: 
- **Exposed weaknesses in the banking system:** Highlighted the dangers of unregulated state banks and unsound lending practices. 
- **Fueled resentment against the national bank:** Many blamed the Second Bank of the [[United States]] for its role in the crisis, strengthening opposition to a strong national bank. This sentiment would later contribute to [[Andrew Jackson]]'s successful campaign against the Bank.
- **Contributed to  [[sectionalism]] :** The Panic hit different regions unevenly, with the South experiencing a more severe and prolonged downturn. This intensified sectional tensions over economic issues like tariffs and internal improvements. 
- **Marked a shift in American economic life:**  The Panic marked a transition from a period of rapid expansion and speculation to one of greater economic uncertainty and caution.
