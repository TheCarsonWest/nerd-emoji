* **[[James Madison]]:** Secretary of State under President [[Thomas Jefferson]].

This ruling established the principle of judicial review, giving the Supreme Court the power to declare laws unconstitutional. 
* **Strengthened the Judicial Branch:** The decision dramatically increased the power and influence of the judicial branch, making it an equal branch of government to the legislative and executive branches.
* **Long-Term Impact:** Marbury v. Madison remains a cornerstone of American government, ensuring a balance of power and safeguarding the Constitution.
