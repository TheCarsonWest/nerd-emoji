# ID: [[Election of 1800]] 
## When: December [[3]], 1800

## Who: 
- **Candidates:** 
    - **[[Thomas Jefferson]]** (Democratic-Republican) and **Aaron Burr** (Democratic-Republican)
    - **[[John Adams]]** (Federalist) and **Charles Cotesworth Pinckney** (Federalist)
- **Other Key Figures:** [[Alexander Hamilton]]

## What: 
- A highly contested presidential election between the Federalist Party ([[John Adams]], incumbent) and the Democratic-Republican Party ([[Thomas Jefferson]]). 
- The election revealed a flaw in the Electoral College system where electors cast two votes for president without specifying which was president and vice president.
- Jefferson and Burr tied in the Electoral College, forcing the election to be decided by the House of Representatives, where each state delegation had one vote.
- After a long deadlock and intense political maneuvering (Hamilton influenced the outcome in favor of Jefferson), Jefferson was elected president.

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
- **Marked the first peaceful transfer of power from one political party to another in the [[United States]]**, establishing a precedent for peaceful transitions of power.
- **Signaled the decline of the Federalist Party** and the rise of the Democratic-Republican Party, ushering in an era of Jeffersonian Democracy.
- **Led to the ratification of the 12th Amendment (1804) to the Constitution**, which altered the Electoral College procedures to prevent a repeat of the 1800 tie, requiring electors to cast separate ballots for president and vice president. 
- **Exemplified the growing partisan divisions** and the intensity of political battles in the early republic.
