# ID: Monroe Doctrine

## When: December 2, 1823

## Who: 
- **President [[James Monroe]]** (The doctrine was written by Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]], but it was part of Monroe's annual message to Congress)

## What: 
A foreign policy statement declaring that:

1. **The Americas were closed to further European colonization.**  Any attempts to colonize or interfere in the Western Hemisphere by European powers would be considered a hostile act against the [[United States]].
2. **The [[United States]] would not interfere in the internal affairs of European nations** or their existing colonies. 
3. **The [[United States]] recognized and would not interfere with existing colonies in the Western Hemisphere.**

## Impact? Why Significant?: 

* **Established the U.S. as a dominant power in the Western Hemisphere.** 
* **Asserted American neutrality in European conflicts,** signaling a departure from its previous involvement in European affairs.
* **Laid the groundwork for future U.S. interventionism in Latin America.** While initially about protecting the Americas from Europe, the Monroe Doctrine would later be used to justify U.S. interventions in Latin American countries.
* **Had little impact at the time** as the U.S. lacked the military strength to enforce it. Its significance grew later in the 19th century as the U.S. became a stronger nation. 
* **Remains a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy today**, though its interpretation and application have evolved over time.
