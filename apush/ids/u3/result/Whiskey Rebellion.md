# ID: [[Whiskey Rebellion]] 

## WHEN: 1791-1794 (rebellion itself mainly in 1794)

## WHO: 
**Imposed by:** Federal government under President George [[Washington]] 
**Opposition:** Farmers, particularly in western [[Pennsylvania]], led by figures like David Bradford and John Holcroft 

## WHAT: 
Uprising in response to a federal excise tax on whiskey, enacted in 1791 to generate revenue and help pay off national debt. Western farmers, who often distilled excess grain into whiskey for easier transport and trade, saw it as an unfair burden.  

## IMPACT: Why Significant?: 
* **Asserted Federal Authority:** Demonstrated the newly formed government's ability and willingness to enforce federal law, even with military force ([[Washington]] sent a militia force to quell the rebellion).
* **Highlighted Sectional Tensions:**  Exposed growing divisions between the more urban, pro-industry East and the agrarian West, foreshadowing future conflicts.
* **Contributed to Political Party Formation:**  The government's response fueled the development of the first party system, with Federalists supporting the tax and Democratic-[[Republicans]] sympathizing with the rebels.
