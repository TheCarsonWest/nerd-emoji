# ID: [[American Temperance Society]] 
## When: 1826
## Who: 
Founded by Lyman Beecher, a prominent Protestant minister, and other evangelical reformers.
## What: 
A national organization dedicated to promoting moderation and eventually complete abstinence from alcohol. The movement gained momentum throughout the 19th century, attracting members from various social classes and backgrounds, including women and religious groups. 
## Impact? Why Significant?: 
- **Heightened awareness of alcohol's social ills:** The ATS effectively utilized moral arguments and vivid imagery to expose the negative consequences of alcohol abuse on individuals, families, and communities. 
- **Political activism:** It spurred a wave of temperance legislation, culminating in the eventual passage of the 18th Amendment (1919) which prohibited the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcohol, ushering in the era of Prohibition.
- **Foundation for other reform movements:** The ATS served as a model for later social reform organizations, particularly those focused on public health and morality, and provided women with a platform for social activism.
