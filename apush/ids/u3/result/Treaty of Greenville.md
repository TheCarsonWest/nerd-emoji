# ID: [[Treaty of Greenville]] 

## When: August [[3]], 1795

## Who: 
* **[[United States]]** represented by General "Mad" Anthony Wayne
* **Native American tribes** of the Northwest Confederacy (including Miami, Shawnee, [[Delaware]], and others)

## What:
A treaty signed after the decisive American victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, ending the Northwest Indian War. In the treaty:
*  Native American tribes ceded a significant portion of their lands in the Northwest Territory (modern-day [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], and parts of [[Michigan]]) to the [[United States]]. 
* The treaty established an official boundary between Native American territory and lands open to white settlement.

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
* **Opened the Northwest Territory to American settlement:**  Led to a wave of white migration and settlement westward, fueling tensions and future conflicts over land.
* **Formalized U.S. dominance in the region:** Established American sovereignty over the Northwest Territory and solidified their claims to the land.
* **Exacerbated tensions with [[Great Britain]]:**  The British had supported the Native American tribes against the U.S. The treaty increased tensions that were already high due to disputes over trade and impressment.
* **Temporary peace, but not a lasting solution:** While it brought an end to immediate violence, the treaty did little to address the underlying issues of land rights and cultural differences, leading to further conflicts in the future.
