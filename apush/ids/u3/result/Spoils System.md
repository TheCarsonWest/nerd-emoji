## ID: Spoils System

## When: Early 1800s (specifically during the presidency of Andrew Jackson, 1829-1837)

## Who: 
* **Andrew Jackson:** President who popularized the practice and made it a significant political strategy.
* **Political Supporters:** Often benefited from the system, being rewarded with government jobs.
* **Civil Servants:**  The existing employees who could be replaced under the system.

## What:
The Spoils System was a practice where victorious political parties would reward their supporters with government jobs. This practice often involved replacing existing government employees with loyal party members, regardless of their qualifications. 

## Impact: Why Significant?: 
* **Increased Political Patronage:**  The system significantly increased the power of political parties and contributed to the growth of political machines.
* **Reduced Government Efficiency:** Replacing qualified employees with unqualified party loyalists often decreased government efficiency and effectiveness.
* **Corruption and Scandal:**  The Spoils System created opportunities for corruption and scandal as positions were often granted based on loyalty rather than merit.
* **Civil Service Reform:** The system's negative consequences eventually led to calls for reform, culminating in the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 which established a merit-based system for hiring government employees.
