# ID: [[Report on the Public Credit]] ## When: January 1790
## Who: 
- **Proposed by:** [[Alexander Hamilton]], the first Secretary of the Treasury
- **Presented to:** Congress

## What: 
A plan to address the national debt incurred during the American Revolution.  The key elements were:
* **Funding the national debt:** The federal government would assume all state debts at face value.
* **Assumption of state debts:**  States with large debts (mostly in the North) favored this, while Southern states with smaller debts were opposed.
* **Creating a national bank:**  A central bank would help manage the nation's finances and issue a stable currency.

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
* **Strengthened the national government:**  By taking on state debts, the federal government gained more power and influence.
* **Promoted economic growth:**  Establishing a stable financial system encouraged investment and trade.
* **Fueled partisan divisions:** The report sparked intense debate between Federalists (who supported Hamilton's plan) and Democratic-[[Republicans]] (who opposed its expansion of federal power), foreshadowing the two-party system. 
* **Compromise & the "Dinner Table bargain":** Led to a compromise where the South agreed to assumption in exchange for the nation's capital being located in the South ([[Washington]] D.C.). This demonstrated the growing [[sectionalism]] in the new nation.
