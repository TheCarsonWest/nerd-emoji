**Marbury v. Madison**

**WHEN:** February 24, 1803

**WHO:**

* John Marshall (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court)

**WHAT:**

* Marbury sued Madison to force him to deliver a judicial commission that had been signed by President [[John Adams]] but not delivered before Adams left office.
* The Supreme Court ruled that Marbury was entitled to the commission but that the Court lacked the authority to order Madison to deliver it because the [[Judiciary Act]] of 1789 was unconstitutional.

**IMPACT:**

* Established the principle of **judicial review**, allowing the Supreme Court to declare laws unconstitutional.
* Strengthened the power of the judiciary.
* Set a precedent for the Court to limit the powers of the other branches of government.
* Contributed to the development of the system of checks and balances.
