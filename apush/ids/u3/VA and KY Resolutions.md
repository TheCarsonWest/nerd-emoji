**WHEN:** December 1825 - February 1833

**WHO:**

* **[[Virginia]] Assembly:** Led by [[James Madison]]

**WHAT:**

* **Resolutions:** State legislative declarations protesting the federal Tariff of 1828, which Southern states saw as unfair.
* **Arguments:** Claimed the tariff was unconstitutional (KY Resolution) and violated states' rights (VA Resolution).
* **Threatened:** Nullification (refusal to enforce the law within state borders) if the tariff was not repealed.

**IMPACT:**

* **Nullification Crisis:** Sparked a major constitutional debate and led to President [[Andrew Jackson]]'s defense of federal authority.

* **Precursor to the Civil War:** The nullification threat foreshadowed the later secession of Southern states over slavery.
