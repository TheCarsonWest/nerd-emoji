** [[Treaty of Greenville]]**

**WHEN:** August 3, 1795

**WHO:** [[United States]] and Native American tribes of the Northwest Territory (present-day [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], and parts of [[Minnesota]])

**WHAT:** The treaty ended the Northwest Indian War and established the boundary between the [[United States]] and the Native American tribes. The Native Americans ceded a large portion of their land to the [[United States]], but they retained some land in exchange for guarantees of protection and hunting rights.

**IMPACT:** The [[Treaty of Greenville]] significantly expanded the territory of the [[United States]] and paved the way for the westward expansion of American settlers. It also established a precedent for the [[United States]] to negotiate treaties with Native American tribes to acquire their land. The treaty was criticized by some Native American leaders, who argued that it was unfair and forced them to give up too much land. However, it was generally seen as a peaceful and necessary settlement that helped to avoid further conflict.
