## ID: [[Populist Party]]

## When: Late 1880s - early 1900s (Founded in 1892, significant impact until early 1900s)

## Who:
* Primarily farmers, agricultural laborers, and working-class individuals in the South and West.
* Leaders included William Jennings Bryan, Ignatius Donnelly, and Tom Watson.

## What:
A political party representing the interests of farmers and laborers in the [[United States]].  They advocated for policies aimed at alleviating economic hardship and addressing issues of industrialization's impact on rural populations.  Key platform elements included:

* **Free Silver:**  Advocated for the free and unlimited coinage of silver, believing it would increase the money supply and benefit debtors.
* **Government Regulation of Railroads:**  Sought government control over railroad rates and practices to prevent exploitation of farmers.
* **Graduated Income Tax:**  Proposed a progressive income tax system where wealthier individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.
* **Direct Election of Senators:**  Called for the direct election of senators by the people, rather than by state legislatures.


## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Voice for the Agrarian West:** Gave a political voice to farmers and laborers who felt marginalized by industrialization and the existing political system.
* **Influence on Progressive Era:** Many of the [[Populists]]' policy proposals were later adopted by the Progressive movement, demonstrating their lasting impact on American politics.  For example, the direct election of senators and the graduated income tax.
* **Third Party Influence:** Though unsuccessful in achieving a national victory, the [[Populists]] demonstrated the power of third parties to influence major parties' platforms.  The [[Democrats]] adopted some Populist issues, most notably the free silver platform.
* **Rise of Bryan:** William Jennings Bryan's campaign for president in 1896, representing the [[Populists]] and [[Democrats]], energized the movement and brought national attention to their concerns.  Even in defeat, it significantly changed political discourse.
* **Decline:** The [[Populist Party]] gradually faded after the 1896 election, but its legacy lives on in the progressive reforms of the early 20th century.
