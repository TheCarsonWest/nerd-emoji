## When: Late 19th and early 20th centuries (roughly 1870s-1913)

## Who: 
* **[[J]]. Pierpont Morgan:**  Financier, banker, and philanthropist.  Head of [[J]].P. Morgan & Co.

## What: 
[[J]].P. Morgan was a highly influential figure in American finance during the [[Gilded Age]]. He dominated corporate finance, railroad reorganization, and industrial consolidation.  Key activities include:
* **Railroad Reorganization:** Restructured numerous bankrupt railroads, creating more efficient and profitable systems through consolidation and financial maneuvering.
* **Industrial Consolidation:** Played a major role in forming massive trusts and holding companies, including U.S. Steel (1901), the largest corporation ever at the time.
* **Financial Panics:**  Often stepped in during financial crises to stabilize the economy, lending money to the government and other institutions (e.g., during the Panic of 1907).
* **International Finance:**  Had significant influence in international markets and often brokered loans to foreign governments.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Consolidation of Industry:** Created monopolies and oligopolies, significantly shaping the American industrial landscape.  This led to increased efficiency but also concerns about economic power concentration.
* **Financial Power:** Exercised immense influence over the American economy, demonstrating the growing power of finance capital.
* **Economic Stability (arguably):**  While his actions benefited him greatly, his interventions in financial panics sometimes prevented economic collapse.
* **Philanthropy:**  Donated significantly to various institutions, including libraries and universities.  However, this philanthropy was intertwined with his business interests and image building.
* **Debate over Capitalism:**  Morgan's actions fueled debates about the nature and ethics of laissez-faire capitalism and the growing power of big business.  His methods contributed to the rise of Progressive Era reforms aiming to curb corporate power.
