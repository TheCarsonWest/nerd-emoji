## ID: Pendleton Civil Service Act

## When: January 16, 1883

## Who: 
* **Sponsor:** Senator George Pendleton (Democrat, Ohio)
* **President:** Chester A. Arthur (Republican)
* **Impact:** Primarily affected federal employees.

* **Meritocracy:**  Emphasized competence and qualifications over political connections for government jobs.
* **Reduced Corruption:** Intended to lessen corruption and inefficiency within the federal bureaucracy.
* **Increased Professionalism:** Contributed to a more professional and stable federal workforce.
* **Limited Impact Initially:** While impactful, the Act initially only covered a small percentage of federal jobs; its reach expanded over time.
* **Long-Term Effects:** Laid the groundwork for a more modern, merit-based civil service system in the United States.
