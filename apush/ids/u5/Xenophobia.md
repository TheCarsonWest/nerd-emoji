## ID: Xenophobia in the Gilded Age

## When: 1870s-1900s (Peak intensity varies by target group, but generally spans the Gilded Age)

## Who:
* **Native-born Americans:**  A significant portion of the population felt threatened by waves of immigration.  Specific groups (e.g., the Know-Nothing Party earlier, but their influence waned; later, more nativist groups emerged).
* **Immigrants:** Primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe (Italians, Poles, Russians, Jews), Asia (Chinese), and Mexico. These groups faced the brunt of xenophobic sentiment.
* **Politicians:** Some politicians exploited anti-immigrant sentiment for political gain, advocating for restrictive legislation.


## What:
Widespread fear and hatred of foreigners, particularly immigrants, fueled by economic anxieties, religious differences, and racial prejudice.  This manifested in various ways:

* **Anti-immigrant legislation:** Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), restrictive immigration quotas later in the period though not yet fully implemented in this era.
* **Violence and discrimination:** Riots targeting specific immigrant groups (e.g., anti-Chinese violence in the West), social exclusion, and job discrimination.
* **Nativist movements:** Organizations advocating for the restriction of immigration and the preservation of American culture as defined by the dominant native-born white population. Propaganda campaigns depicting immigrants negatively.
* **Scapegoating:** Immigrants were often blamed for social problems like unemployment, poverty, and crime.


## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Shaping of Immigration Policy:**  The period laid the groundwork for increasingly restrictive immigration policies in the 20th century.
* **Social and Cultural Impact:** Created deep social divisions and fostered discrimination against specific immigrant communities, leaving lasting legacies on American society.
* **Political Influence:** Xenophobia played a significant role in shaping political discourse and influenced the actions of both voters and elected officials.
* **Economic Consequences:** While immigrants contributed significantly to the nation's economic growth,  xenophobic policies and actions limited their opportunities and created social unrest.
* **Rise of nativism:** Fueled the growth of nativist movements and organizations that would continue to influence American politics for decades to come.
