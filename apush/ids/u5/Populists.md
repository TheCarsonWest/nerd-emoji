## ID: Populist Movement

## When: Late 1880s - early 1900s (roughly 1890-1900, peaking around 1892-1896)

## Who:
* **Farmers:** Primarily small farmers in the South and West, facing economic hardship.
* **Laborers:** Industrial workers who also experienced exploitation and low wages.
* **Key Leaders:** William Jennings Bryan, Ignatius Donnelly, Mary Elizabeth Lease.

## What: 
A political movement representing agrarian interests, primarily farmers, that sought to address economic inequality and political corruption during the [[Gilded Age]].  They advocated for government regulation of railroads and big business, increased money supply (free silver), graduated income tax, and direct election of senators.  The movement culminated in the election of 1896.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Challenged the Status Quo:** The [[Populists]] significantly challenged the power of established political parties ([[Democrats]] and [[Republicans]]) and big business.
* **Advocated for Progressive Reforms:**  Many of the [[Populists]]' demands, such as government regulation and income tax, were later adopted as progressive reforms.
* **Increased Political Participation:** The movement encouraged greater participation in politics, particularly among farmers and working-class citizens.
* **Influence on the Democratic Party:** The Populist platform significantly influenced the Democratic Party's platform, particularly concerning the issue of free silver.  The [[Democrats]]' adoption of this issue led to the famous "Cross of Gold" speech.
* **Election of 1896:** William Jennings Bryan, representing the fusion of [[Populists]] and [[Democrats]], ran for president but lost to [[William McKinley]]. This defeat marked the end of the [[Populist Party]] as a major force, but many of its goals influenced later political movements.
* **Legacy of Reform:** Although ultimately unsuccessful in achieving all of their goals, the [[Populists]] helped to lay the groundwork for future progressive reforms and the expansion of democracy.
