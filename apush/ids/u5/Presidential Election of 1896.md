## ID: [[Presidential Election of 1896]]

## When: November [[3]], 1896

## Who:
* **Republican:** [[William McKinley]] (won)
* **Democratic:** William Jennings Bryan
* **Populist:** William Jennings Bryan (fused with [[Democrats]])


## What: 
A pivotal presidential election focusing on the issue of bimetallism (using both gold and silver as currency).  McKinley, supported by big business and the establishment, advocated for the gold standard. Bryan, the charismatic "Great Commoner," championed free silver, appealing to farmers and laborers burdened by debt.  The election was characterized by intense campaigning and high voter turnout.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **End of Populism as a major force:** Although Bryan received significant popular votes, his loss marked the decline of the [[Populist Party]] as a major independent force in American politics. Their platform, however, continued to influence the Progressive movement.
* **Triumph of the [[Gold Standard]]:** McKinley's victory solidified the gold standard as the nation's monetary policy, benefiting creditors and big business but potentially harming farmers and working class struggling with debt.
* **Shift in Political Landscape:** The election signified a realignment in party allegiances and marked the beginning of a long period of Republican dominance.
* **Modern Campaigning Techniques:** The 1896 campaign saw the widespread use of new technologies and strategies, including the use of railroads for extensive campaigning, professional campaign managers, and sophisticated media outreach to reach a larger electorate. This demonstrated the increasing significance of mass communication and organization in political campaigns.
* **Regional Divide:** The election highlighted the deep economic and social divisions between the agrarian South and West, and the industrial North and East. Bryan's strong showing in the South and West demonstrated this regional split.
