## ID: [[John D. Rockefeller]]

## When: 1839-1937 (Life Span);  1870s-1911 (Peak of Standard Oil)

## Who: 
* **[[John D. Rockefeller]]:** Founder of Standard Oil Company.

## What: 
[[John D. Rockefeller]] was a prominent American industrialist and philanthropist.  He built his wealth through Standard Oil, using ruthless business tactics such as horizontal and vertical integration to establish a near-monopoly on the oil industry. His practices exemplified the excesses and controversies of the [[Gilded Age]].

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Horizontal Integration:**  Rockefeller bought out competing oil refineries, eliminating competition and controlling a vast majority of oil production.
* **Vertical Integration:**  Standard Oil controlled every aspect of the oil industry, from drilling to refining to distribution, maximizing profits and minimizing costs.
* **Trusts:** Rockefeller utilized trusts (legal entities that allowed him to control multiple companies without technically owning them) to further consolidate his power and evade antitrust laws.
* **Monopoly Power:**  Standard Oil's dominance led to accusations of price gouging and unfair business practices, sparking public outcry and calls for government regulation.
* **Antitrust Movement:** Rockefeller's success and aggressive tactics significantly contributed to the rise of the progressive movement and the passage of antitrust legislation, like the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 (though initially ineffective against Standard Oil).
* **Philanthropy:**  Later in life, Rockefeller became a major philanthropist, donating vast sums of money to education, medicine, and other causes, establishing institutions like the Rockefeller Foundation and University of Chicago.  This philanthropy, however, did not erase the criticisms of his business practices.
* **Symbol of the [[Gilded Age]]:** Rockefeller embodies both the immense wealth creation and the social and economic inequality of the [[Gilded Age]], serving as a case study of the era's capitalist practices and their consequences.
