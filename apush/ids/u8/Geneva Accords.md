Okay, here's a notecard following your format on the Geneva Accords:

## ID: [[Geneva Accords]] 
## When: July 21, 1954

## Who:
*   Representatives from: France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the State of Vietnam (Bao Dai's government), the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh's government), Laos, and Cambodia. The [[United States]] was an observer but did not sign.

## What:
*   A set of agreements that temporarily divided Vietnam into two zones: a northern zone to be governed by the Viet Minh (Ho Chi Minh's communist forces), and a southern zone to be governed by the State of Vietnam (later, the Republic of Vietnam).
*   Called for a general election to be held in July 1956 to reunify the country under a single government.
*   Guaranteed the independence of Laos and Cambodia.
*   Provided for the regrouping of forces and the exchange of prisoners.
*   Established a demilitarized zone (DMZ) along the 17th parallel separating the two Vietnams.

## Impact: Why Significant?
*   **Temporary Division of Vietnam:** While intended to be temporary, the division solidified and led to the escalating conflict and eventual Vietnam War.
*   **US Involvement:** The US, fearing communist expansion, refused to sign the Accords and began supporting the South Vietnamese government, setting the stage for direct American intervention.
*   **Failure of Reunification Elections:** The scheduled 1956 elections were never held, largely due to South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem's (with US backing) concerns about a communist victory. This deepened the divide and fueled further conflict.
*   **Escalation of [[Cold War]] Tensions:** The [[Geneva Accords]] and their aftermath became a major flashpoint in the Cold War, with the US and the Soviet Union backing opposing sides.
*   **Laos and Cambodia:** While aimed at guaranteeing their neutrality, Laos and Cambodia were also drawn into the regional conflict, experiencing civil wars and becoming battlegrounds in the larger struggle.
