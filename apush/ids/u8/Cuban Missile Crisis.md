## ID: [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] 
## WHEN: October 16-28, 1962

## WHO:
*   **United States:** President John F. Kennedy, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara
*   **Soviet Union:** Premier Nikita Khrushchev
*   **Cuba:** Fidel Castro

## WHAT:
A 13-day confrontation between the [[United States]] and the Soviet Union initiated by the American discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba, just 90 miles from the U.S. mainland. Kennedy ordered a naval "quarantine" (blockade) of Cuba to prevent further Soviet shipments and demanded the removal of the existing missiles. Negotiations ensued between the US and the USSR, teetering on the brink of nuclear war. Ultimately, a deal was reached where the Soviets agreed to remove the missiles from Cuba in exchange for a US pledge not to invade Cuba and a secret agreement to remove US Jupiter missiles from Turkey.

## IMPACT: Why Significant?:
*   **Closest to Nuclear War:** Considered the closest the world has ever come to nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union.
*   **Limited Test Ban Treaty (1963):** Led to increased efforts towards arms control and a desire to reduce tensions. The Limited Test Ban Treaty prohibited nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater.
*   **Hotline Established:** A direct communication "hotline" was established between [[Washington]] D.C. and Moscow to facilitate direct communication between leaders in future crises.
*   **Shifting [[Cold War]] Dynamics:** The crisis exposed the dangers of [[Cold War]] brinkmanship and the need for more cautious and nuanced diplomacy. It somewhat changed the relationship between the US and USSR.
*   **Impact on Cuba:** Strengthened Castro's regime in Cuba, as the US pledged not to invade. However, Cuba remained a focal point of US foreign policy throughout the Cold War.
* **Increased Mistrust:** Although a deal was met, both sides left the crisis with increased mistrust of the others intentions.
