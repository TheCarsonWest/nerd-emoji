## ID: Roe v. Wade

## When: January 22, 1973

## Who:

*   **Supreme Court Justices:** A majority of the Supreme Court, including Justice Harry Blackmun, who wrote the majority opinion.

## What:
A landmark decision by the [[United States]] Supreme Court. The Court ruled that the Constitution protects a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. The decision struck down many federal and state abortion laws and established a trimester framework:
*   **First Trimester:** The state could not prohibit abortions.
*   **Second Trimester:** The state could regulate abortions to protect the woman's health.
*   **Third Trimester:** The state could prohibit abortions, except when necessary to save the life or health of the mother.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
*   **Legalized Abortion Nationally:** Legalized abortion across the United States, establishing a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.
*   **Triggered Political Polarization:** Sparked intense and ongoing political debate between "pro-choice" and "pro-life" movements.
*   **Foundation for Future Privacy Rights:** Based on the right to privacy implied by the Fourteenth Amendment, which has been used in other cases involving personal autonomy.
*   **Ongoing Legal Challenges:** Faced numerous legal challenges and attempts to overturn or restrict access to abortion since the ruling.
*   **Divided Public Opinion:** Continues to be a highly divisive issue, influencing elections, legislation, and social activism.
