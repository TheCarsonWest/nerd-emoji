Okay, here are several notecards covering key aspects of the Vietnam War, formatted for APUSH:

## ID: [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] 
## When: August 7, 1964

## Who:
*   **US Congress:** Authorized President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] *   **President Lyndon B. Johnson:** Sought the resolution after alleged attacks on U.S. Navy ships.
*   **North Vietnam:** Accused of attacking U.S. ships in the Gulf of Tonkin.

## What:
A joint resolution passed by the U.S. Congress in response to alleged attacks on U.S. destroyers (USS Maddox and USS Turner Joy) in the Gulf of Tonkin. It authorized President Johnson to take "all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the [[United States]] and to prevent further aggression" in Southeast Asia.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
*   **Escalation of the War:** The resolution gave President Johnson a "blank check" to escalate U.S. involvement in Vietnam without a formal declaration of war.
*   **Increased Presidential Power:** Significantly expanded the President's war-making powers.
*   **Limited Congressional Oversight:** Reduced Congress's role in overseeing the war.
*   **Debate and Controversy:** Later investigations raised doubts about the veracity of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents, fueling anti-war sentiment and distrust of the government. The resolution was repealed in 1971.

## ID: [[Tet Offensive]] 
## When: January 30, 1968 (Vietnamese Lunar New Year - Tet)

## Who:
*   **North Vietnamese Army (NVA):** Led the offensive.
*   **Viet Cong (VC):** South Vietnamese communist guerillas, participated in the attacks.
*   **US and South Vietnamese Forces:** Defended against the offensive.

## What:
A series of surprise attacks by the NVA and VC during the Tet holiday in South Vietnam. They targeted major cities, military bases, and government buildings throughout the country, including the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
*   **Turning Point:** While a military failure for the communists (they suffered heavy losses), it was a major psychological and political victory.
*   **Erosion of Public Support:**  The offensive shattered public confidence in the Johnson administration's claims that the war was being won.  Americans saw the reality of the conflict on television.
*   **Increased Anti-War Sentiment:** Fueled the anti-war movement and led to widespread protests.
*   **Johnson's Withdrawal:**  Played a significant role in President Johnson's decision not to seek re-election in 1968.
*   **De-escalation:** Prompted a reassessment of U.S. strategy in Vietnam, leading to a gradual withdrawal of troops.

## ID: Vietnamization

## When: 1969-1973 (Nixon Administration)

## Who:
*   **President Richard Nixon:** Initiated and implemented the policy.
*   **Henry Kissinger:** National Security Advisor, played a key role in negotiating with North Vietnam.
*   **South Vietnamese Army (ARVN):** Intended to be strengthened and take over the fighting.

## What:
A policy implemented by the Nixon administration to gradually withdraw U.S. troops from Vietnam and transfer the responsibility for fighting the war to the ARVN. It involved equipping, training, and advising the South Vietnamese forces to enable them to defend themselves against the communist North.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
*   **Reduced U.S. Casualties:** Lowered American troop deaths and injuries, addressing a major concern of the anti-war movement.
*   **"Peace with Honor":** Nixon sought to withdraw from Vietnam without appearing to abandon South Vietnam to communism.
*   **ARVN Ineffectiveness:** The ARVN proved unable to effectively resist the North Vietnamese, especially after the U.S. withdrew air support.
*   **Paris Peace Accords:** Led to the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in 1973.
*   **Fall of Saigon:** Ultimately failed to prevent the communist takeover of South Vietnam in 1975.

## ID: Paris Peace Accords

## When: January 27, 1973

## Who:
*   **United States:** Represented by Henry Kissinger.
*   **North Vietnam:** Represented by Le Duc Tho (though he refused the Nobel Peace Prize).
*   **South Vietnam:** Initially reluctant to sign.
*   **Viet Cong:** Also involved in the negotiations.

## What:
A peace agreement signed in Paris that was intended to bring an end to the Vietnam War. It called for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of all U.S. troops, and the exchange of prisoners of war.  It also allowed North Vietnamese troops to remain in South Vietnam.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
*   **U.S. Withdrawal:** Led to the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam.
*   **Unstable Peace:** The agreement was fragile and ultimately failed to prevent the resumption of fighting between North and South Vietnam.
*   **Fall of South Vietnam:**  With the US out of the picture and no support coming, the agreement paved the way for the North Vietnamese victory in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.
*   **POW/MIA Issue:** The agreement addressed the issue of American prisoners of war and missing in action.
*   **End of U.S. Involvement:** Marked the end of direct U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War.

## ID: War Powers Act

## When: November 7, 1973

## Who:
*   **U.S. Congress:** Passed the act.
*   **President:** The act was intended to limit the President's power.

## What:
A federal law intended to check the president's power to commit the [[United States]] to an armed conflict without the consent of the U.S. Congress. It requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and forbids armed forces from remaining for more than 60 days, with a further 30-day withdrawal period, without congressional authorization or a declaration of war.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
*   **Limits Presidential Power:** A response to the expansion of presidential war-making power during the Vietnam War.
*   **Reasserts Congressional Authority:** Aims to restore Congress's constitutional role in declaring war.
*   **Controversy:** Presidents have often argued that the act is unconstitutional and have sometimes acted in ways that appeared to circumvent it.
*   **Ongoing Debate:**  The effectiveness and constitutionality of the War Powers Act remain subjects of debate.
*   **Shapes Foreign Policy:**  Continues to influence the relationship between the executive and legislative branches in foreign policy decision-making.

These notecards provide a solid foundation for understanding the key aspects of the [[Vietnam War]] within the context of the APUSH curriculum. Remember to study beyond these cards and consider the broader themes and connections to other periods in U.S. history. Good luck!
