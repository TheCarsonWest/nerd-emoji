## ID: [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] 
## When: July 2, 1964

## Who:
*   **President:** [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (signed the bill into law)
*   **Key Supporters:** Civil Rights Activists (Martin Luther King Jr., etc.), members of Congress from both parties (though faced significant opposition, especially from Southern Democrats).

## What:
Landmark legislation that outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Specifically:

*   Banned discrimination in public accommodations (hotels, restaurants, theaters, etc.).
*   Prohibited discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce this.
*   Strengthened voting rights provisions.
*   Allowed the federal government to file lawsuits to desegregate schools.
*   Authorized the termination of federal funding to programs that discriminated.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
*   **Legal Foundation for Equality:** Provided a strong legal basis for challenging discrimination and advancing civil rights.
*   **End of Jim Crow:** Significantly weakened Jim Crow laws and practices in the South.
*   **Expanded Opportunities:** Opened up opportunities in employment, education, and public accommodations for African Americans and other minority groups.
*   **Increased Political Participation:** Contributed to increased African American voter registration and political participation.
*   **Continuing Struggle:** While a monumental achievement, the Act did not eliminate racism or discrimination entirely. The [[Civil Rights Movement]] continued to address issues such as economic inequality and systemic racism. The Act laid the groundwork for future civil rights legislation, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
