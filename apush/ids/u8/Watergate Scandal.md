## WHAT:
A major political scandal that began with a break-in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in June 1972. Investigations revealed a broader pattern of illegal activities by the Nixon administration, including:

*   **The break-in itself:** An attempt to bug the DNC headquarters and steal campaign information.
*   **Cover-up:** Nixon and his aides attempted to cover up the administration's involvement in the break-in.
*   **Obstruction of Justice:** Lying to investigators, destroying evidence, and using the CIA to impede the FBI's investigation.
*   **Abuse of Power:** Use of government agencies (FBI, IRS, CIA) to harass political opponents.
*   **Illegal Campaign Contributions:** Violations of campaign finance laws.
*   **Nixon's secret taping system:** Revelations of a system that recorded conversations in the Oval Office ultimately proved Nixon's involvement. He was ordered to release these tapes.
*   **Saturday Night Massacre:** Nixon ordered the firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox when he demanded the tapes, leading to the resignations of Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus.

## IMPACT:
* **Nixon's Resignation:** Facing impeachment by the House of Representatives and near-certain conviction by the Senate, Nixon resigned from office in August 1974.
* **Ford's Pardon of Nixon:** Gerald Ford, Nixon's successor, pardoned Nixon, sparking controversy but aiming to heal the nation.
*   **Erosion of Public Trust:**  The scandal significantly damaged public trust in government and political institutions. It fostered widespread cynicism about politicians and the presidency.
*   **Strengthening of Investigative Journalism:** Woodward and Bernstein's reporting highlighted the importance of a free press and investigative journalism in holding those in power accountable.
*   **Campaign Finance Reform:** The scandal led to reforms in campaign finance laws to limit contributions and increase transparency.
*   **Governmental Ethics Reforms:** Increased emphasis on government ethics and accountability, including the creation of stricter ethical guidelines for government officials.
*   **War Powers Act:** Although not a direct result, Watergate contributed to a climate of distrust that led to the passage of the War Powers Act in 1973, limiting presidential power to commit troops without Congressional approval.
* **Lasting Legacy:** The term "Watergate" became synonymous with political scandal and abuse of power. It continues to be referenced in discussions of governmental wrongdoing.
