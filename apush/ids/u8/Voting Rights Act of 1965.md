## ID: [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] 
## When: August 6, 1965

## Who:
*   **President Lyndon B. Johnson:** Championed and signed the act into law.
*   **Civil Rights Movement Leaders:** e.g., Martin Luther King Jr., whose activism and advocacy helped push for the legislation.
*   **African American Voters:** The Act directly aimed to protect their voting rights.
*   **Congress:** Debated and passed the legislation.
*   **Southern States:** States with a history of voter discrimination.

## What:

A landmark piece of federal legislation in the [[United States]] that outlawed discriminatory voting practices that had been responsible for widespread disenfranchisement of African Americans in the U.S., especially in the South. Specifically:

*   **Outlawed literacy tests and other discriminatory devices:** That had been used to prevent Black citizens from registering to vote.
*   **Authorized federal oversight of voter registration:** In areas with a history of discrimination.
*   **Authorized the U.S. Attorney General to investigate the use of poll taxes:** In state and local elections. (Poll taxes were later outlawed by the Supreme Court in *Harper v. [[Virginia]] Board of Elections* (1966))

## Impact: Why Significant?:

*   **Increased Black Voter Registration & Turnout:** Dramatically increased the number of African Americans registered to vote and participating in elections, especially in the South.
*   **Increased Black Political Representation:** Led to a significant increase in the number of Black elected officials at all levels of government.
*   **Empowered African American Communities:** Gave Black communities greater political power and influence.
*   **Shift in Southern Politics:** Forced a change in political strategies in the South, as politicians had to appeal to Black voters.
*   **Controversies and Amendments:** The Act has been amended several times since its passage and has been subject to legal challenges, including *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013), which weakened a key provision regarding preclearance, leading to renewed concerns about voter suppression in some states.
*   **Legacy of Expanding Suffrage:** Built upon earlier civil rights legislation and Supreme Court decisions, further expanding suffrage and solidifying the principle of equal voting rights for all citizens.
