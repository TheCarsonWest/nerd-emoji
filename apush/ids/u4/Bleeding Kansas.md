# ID: Bleeding Kansas

## When: 1854-1858

## Who:
* **Pro-slavery forces:**  Missourians, Border Ruffians, Southern sympathizers
* **Anti-slavery forces:** Free-Staters, abolitionists, New England Emigrant Aid Company

## What:
A period of violent conflict in Kansas Territory over whether it would be admitted to the Union as a free or slave state. This occurred after the passage of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], which repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]] and allowed for [[popular sovereignty]] to decide the status of slavery in new territories.

## Impact: Why Significant?: 
* **Heightened sectional tensions:** Bleeding Kansas significantly inflamed tensions between the North and South, pushing the nation closer to Civil War.
* **Violence and bloodshed:** The violence in Kansas, including the sacking of Lawrence and the Pottawatomie Massacre, illustrated the ferocity of the debate over slavery.
* **Rise of abolitionist movement:** The events in Kansas solidified the resolve of many abolitionists to fight for the end of slavery.
* **Political polarization:** The conflict further divided the political landscape, contributing to the formation of the Republican Party.
* **Precursor to Civil War:** Bleeding Kansas served as a violent foreshadowing of the larger conflict that would erupt in 1861.
