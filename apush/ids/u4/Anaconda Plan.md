# ID: Anaconda Plan

## When:  1861 - 1865 (During the American Civil War)

## Who:  
* **General Winfield Scott:**  The Union's General-in-Chief, who formulated the strategy.
* **President Abraham Lincoln:**  Approved and authorized the plan.

## What: 
The Anaconda Plan was a strategic military plan devised by Union General Winfield Scott to blockade Confederate ports, control the Mississippi River, and gradually squeeze the Confederacy into submission.  This strategy aimed to cut off the South's supply lines, cripple its economy, and ultimately force its surrender.

## Impact: Why Significant? 
The Anaconda Plan significantly impacted the course of the Civil War. It: 

* **Established a naval blockade:** This effectively choked off Southern trade and exports, weakening the Confederate economy. 
* **Controlled the Mississippi River:**  Cutting off the South's ability to transport resources and troops.
* **Gradual pressure on the Confederacy:** It helped to isolate the South and make its surrender more likely. 
* **Prolonged the War:** While effective, the strategy was slow, leading to a long and bloody conflict. 

The Anaconda Plan, though initially criticized for its slow pace, proved highly effective in bringing about the Union victory in the Civil War.
