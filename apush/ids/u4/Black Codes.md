## ID: [[Black Codes]] 
## When: 1865-1866 (immediately following the [[Civil War]])

## Who: 
* Southern State Legislatures 
* Former Confederate officials
* White Southerners seeking to maintain control over Black populations

## What: 
* Laws passed by Southern states to restrict the freedoms of formerly enslaved people.
* These codes aimed to control Black labor, movement, and social interactions.
* Examples:
    * **Vagrancy Laws:**  Criminalized idleness and forced Black people to work for white employers.
    * **Apprenticeship Laws:** Allowed white employers to bind Black children to forced labor.
    * **Convict Leasing:** Punished minor offenses with harsh prison sentences, allowing states to lease out Black convicts for labor.
    * **Restrictions on Land Ownership:** Made it difficult for Black people to buy or own land.

## Impact: Why Significant?: 
* **Undermined Reconstruction:** The [[Black Codes]] directly contradicted the goals of Reconstruction, which sought to establish equal rights for Black Americans.
* **Fueled Racial Tensions:** The codes intensified racial tensions and contributed to the rise of white supremacy.
* **Led to Federal Intervention:** The [[Black Codes]] prompted Congress to pass the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] and the [[14th amendment]], which sought to protect Black citizens from discriminatory state laws.
* **Shaped the Future of Race Relations:** The [[Black Codes]] set a dangerous precedent for racial discrimination and segregation, which would continue to plague the [[United States]] for decades to come.
