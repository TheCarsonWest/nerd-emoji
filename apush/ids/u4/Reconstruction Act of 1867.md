## ID: [[Reconstruction Act of 1867]] 

## When: March [[2]], 1867

## Who: 
* **Congress:** The [[Radical Republicans]] in Congress, led by figures like Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, were the primary force behind the act.
* **President [[Andrew Johnson]]:** He strongly opposed the act and vetoed it, but Congress overrode his veto.

## What: 
The [[Reconstruction Act of 1867]] divided the South into five military districts, each governed by a Union general. It mandated the establishment of new state governments based on universal male suffrage (excluding former Confederate officials and soldiers). This effectively disenfranchised most white Southerners and allowed Black men to participate in the political process for the first time.

## Impact: 
The Reconstruction Act had a profound impact on the South:

* **Black Political Participation:** This act paved the way for the election of Black representatives to state and national government.
* **Formation of Southern Republican Parties:** The act helped establish strong Republican parties in the South, largely composed of Black voters and white Northerners who had relocated to the region.
* **Reconstruction Governments:** It led to the establishment of Reconstruction governments in the South, characterized by attempts to reform the region's political and social landscape, including establishing public schools and social welfare programs.
* **Increased Conflict:** The act significantly increased tensions between the North and South, leading to violent resistance from white Southerners. 
* **Legacy:**  The Reconstruction Act laid the groundwork for the advancement of civil rights for African Americans, but it also led to the rise of white supremacist organizations that would ultimately undermine the efforts of Reconstruction.
