## ID: The New Republican Party of 1850

## When: 1854

## Who: 
* **Founders:**  Anti-slavery Whigs, [[Democrats]], and Free Soilers
* **Key Leaders:** Salmon P. Chase,  [[Abraham Lincoln]],  and Horace Greeley

## What:
The Republican Party was formed as a direct response to the [[Kansas]]-[[Nebraska Act]], which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into new territories. The party advocated for a platform based on opposing the expansion of slavery,  supporting free labor, and promoting economic development. 

## Impact: Why Significant?:
The formation of the Republican Party marked a major turning point in American politics. It:

* **Solidified a national anti-slavery movement:** By uniting diverse anti-slavery factions, the party provided a powerful voice for those opposed to the expansion of slavery.
* **Promoted [[sectionalism]]:**  The party's focus on slavery further deepened the North-South divide, ultimately leading to the [[Civil War]].
* **Led to the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]]:** Lincoln's victory in the 1860 election, largely due to Republican support, ignited the secession of Southern states and triggered the [[Civil War]].

The Republican Party, despite its initial focus on the issue of slavery, would ultimately become a major force in American politics, shaping the nation's future for decades to come.
