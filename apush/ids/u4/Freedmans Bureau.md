# ID: Freedmen's Bureau 
## When: March 3, 1865 - 1872
## Who: 
Established by Congress during Reconstruction, headed by General Oliver O. Howard
## What: 
A federal agency created to help former slaves transition to freedom. It provided food, clothing, shelter, medical care, education, legal assistance, and helped reunite families.  
## Impact: Why Significant?: 
The Freedmen's Bureau played a crucial role in the lives of millions of formerly enslaved people, though it was met with resistance from white Southerners. It facilitated the establishment of schools and colleges for African Americans, provided land for farming, and helped to establish a legal system that protected the rights of freedmen. However, the agency faced significant challenges due to limited funding, inadequate staffing, and the  political climate of the time. 

* **Limited Success:** While impactful, it was underfunded and hampered by white Southern resistance.
* **Legacy:**  It contributed to the development of African American communities and institutions.  It remains a symbol of the federal government's attempts to aid formerly enslaved people, and a reminder of the challenges of Reconstruction.
