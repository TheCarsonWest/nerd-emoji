## ID: Popular Sovereignty (Antebellum)

## When: 1840s-1860s

## Who:  
* **Advocates:**  [[Abraham Lincoln]], Stephen Douglas, Northern Whigs and Republicans
* **Opponents:** Southern [[Democrats]], Pro-Slavery advocates

## What: 
Popular sovereignty was the idea that residents of a territory should decide for themselves whether or not to allow slavery. It was championed as a compromise solution to the escalating conflict over slavery's expansion. This concept was put into practice through the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] of 1854.

## Impact:  
* **Fueling the Civil War:** Popular sovereignty failed to resolve the issue of slavery's expansion. Instead, it led to violence and bloodshed in [[Kansas]] ([[Bleeding Kansas]]), as pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces clashed. This conflict further divided the nation and contributed to the outbreak of the Civil War.
* **Rise of the Republican Party:**  The [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] and the resulting turmoil in [[Kansas]] led to the formation of the Republican Party, which was opposed to the expansion of slavery. The Republican Party's rise signaled a shift in American politics and paved the way for the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860. 
* **Erosion of Compromise:**  The idea of popular sovereignty, initially seen as a compromise, ultimately proved to be unsustainable. It failed to address the fundamental moral and political questions surrounding slavery, exacerbating tensions between the North and South.
