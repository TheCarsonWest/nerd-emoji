# ID: [[Emancipation Proclamation]] 
## When: January 1, 1863

## Who: President [[Abraham Lincoln]] 
## What: 
A presidential proclamation issued during the [[Civil War]] that declared all slaves in Confederate-held territory to be free. It did not apply to slaves in border states loyal to the Union.

## Impact: 
* **Shifted the purpose of the war:**  The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] transformed the [[Civil War]] from a conflict primarily about preserving the Union into a fight for the abolition of slavery. 
* **Strengthened the moral high ground:** The proclamation gave the Union cause a powerful moral justification, attracting support from abolitionists and international observers. 
* **Weakened the Confederacy:** The Proclamation effectively freed slaves in Confederate-held areas, depriving the Confederacy of a significant labor force and military resource.
* **Set the stage for Reconstruction:** The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] laid the groundwork for the [[13th amendment]], which officially abolished slavery in the [[United States]], and the subsequent Reconstruction era focused on integrating former slaves into American society.
