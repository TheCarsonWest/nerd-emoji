## ID: Sectionalism

## When: 1780s - 1860s 

## Who: 
* **North:** Industrialists, abolitionists, farmers in the Northeast and Midwest
* **South:** Plantation owners, slaveholders, farmers in the South
* **West:** Farmers, miners, and settlers moving westward
* **Key figures:** Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster

## What: 
A deep-seated division in the [[United States]] based on geographic, economic, social, and political differences between the North, South, and West. These differences often led to conflict over issues like slavery, tariffs, and states' rights.

**Key features of Sectionalism:**
* **Economic differences:** Industrial North vs. Agricultural South 
* **Social differences:** Abolitionism in the North vs. Slaveholding in the South
* **Political differences:** Federalist vs. Democratic-Republican parties
* **Territorial expansion:** Debate over slavery in new territories

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Increased tension and conflict:** [[Sectionalism]] fueled debates over slavery, westward expansion, and the role of the federal government, ultimately leading to the [[Civil War]]. 
* **Compromises and political maneuvering:** To maintain unity, political leaders attempted to forge compromises, such as the [[Missouri]] Compromise (1820) and the [[Compromise of 1850]]. However, these often proved temporary and only deepened the divisions.
* **Rise of sectional political parties:** The rise of the Whig and Democratic parties reflected the growing divide between the North and South. 
* **Formation of the Confederate States of America:** [[Sectionalism]] ultimately led to the secession of Southern states in 1860-1861 and the formation of the Confederacy.

**Examples of Sectional Conflicts:**
* **[[Nullification]] Crisis (1832-1833)**: [[South Carolina]]'s attempt to nullify the federal tariff.
* **Mexican-American War (1846-1848)**: Debate over the expansion of slavery into new territories.
* **[[Compromise of 1850]]:** A temporary solution to the issue of slavery in the territories, but further fueled tensions.
* **[[Kansas]]-[[Nebraska Act]] (1854):** Allowed for [[popular sovereignty]] to decide on the issue of slavery in the territories, leading to violence and bloodshed in [[Kansas]].
* **Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857):** Supreme Court decision that ruled that slaves were not citizens and had no rights, further dividing the nation.
