# ID: Sharecropping
## When: Post-Civil War (1865-1900)
## Who:
* Former slaves
* White landowners
## What:
A system of agriculture in which landowners provided land, seed, and tools to tenants, who in return paid a portion of their crop to the landowner. This system often trapped former slaves in a cycle of debt, as they rarely had the resources to purchase their own land.
## Impact: Why Significant?: 
* **Economic Dependence:** Sharecropping perpetuated a cycle of poverty and economic dependence for former slaves, hindering their ability to achieve true economic freedom.
* **Social Stratification:** It reinforced existing social and racial hierarchies, limiting opportunities for African Americans and perpetuating white supremacy.
* **Political Disenfranchisement:** The lack of economic independence contributed to the disenfranchisement of African Americans, making it harder for them to participate in the political process and fight for their rights.
* **Legacy of Inequality:** The legacy of sharecropping continues to affect the economic and social disparities between blacks and whites in the South today.
