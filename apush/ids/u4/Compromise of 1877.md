## ID: [[Compromise of 1877]] 
## When:  Late 1876-Early 1877 (Specifically, the Presidential Election of 1876 was contested and the final outcome was decided in February 1877)

## Who:
* **Samuel [[J]]. Tilden:** Democratic Presidential Candidate 
* **[[Rutherford B]]. Hayes]]:** Republican Presidential Candidate 
* **The Electoral Commission:** A bipartisan group created by Congress to settle the disputed election results. 
* **Southern [[Democrats]]:**  They supported Tilden and made concessions in exchange for the withdrawal of federal troops from the South.

## What:
* **Contested Election of 1876:**  The Presidential election between Tilden and Hayes was extremely close.  Several states, particularly in the South, had conflicting election results, leading to disputes over who won.
* **The Electoral Commission:** Congress created this commission to settle the election dispute.  It was made up of five Representatives, five Senators, and five Supreme Court justices.
* **Bargaining and Compromise:** Southern [[Democrats]] ultimately agreed to support Hayes' election in exchange for a number of concessions from [[Republicans]], including the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, federal funding for Southern infrastructure, and the appointment of a Southerner to Hayes' cabinet. 

## Impact: 
* **End of Reconstruction:** The [[Compromise of 1877]] effectively ended Reconstruction in the South.  Federal protection of African American civil rights ceased, and white Southerners were able to regain political and economic power. 
* **Rise of Jim Crow:**  With the end of Reconstruction, Southern states passed "Jim Crow" laws that severely limited African American rights and segregated society. 
* **Economic Development in the South:**  The Compromise led to federal support for Southern infrastructure, which helped to boost the region's economy.
* **Shift in Political Power:** The compromise helped to solidify the Republican Party's control over the national government, but it also alienated African Americans and gave the South more political autonomy.
