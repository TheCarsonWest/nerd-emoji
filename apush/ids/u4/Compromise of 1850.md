# ID: Compromise of 1850

## When: September 9, 1850

## Who: 
* **Henry Clay** (proposed the compromise)
* **Daniel Webster** (spoke in favor of the compromise)
* **John C. Calhoun** (opposed the compromise)
* **Stephen Douglas** (helped pass the compromise)
* **Zachary Taylor** (President at the time)

## What: 
A series of five bills passed by Congress to ease tensions between the North and South over the issue of slavery. The Compromise included:

* **Admission of California as a free state:** This tipped the balance in the Senate in favor of free states.
* **Strengthening the Fugitive Slave Act:** This required Northern states to return escaped slaves to their owners.
* **Abolition of the slave trade in Washington D.C.:** However, slavery itself was not banned in the capital.
* **Establishing a boundary between Texas and New Mexico:** This resolved a territorial dispute and left New Mexico's status open to popular sovereignty.
* **Popular Sovereignty in the territories:** This allowed residents of territories to decide for themselves whether or not to allow slavery.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
The Compromise of 1850 temporarily quelled the growing sectional tensions that threatened to tear the country apart. However, it also sowed the seeds for future conflict:

* **Increased tensions between North and South:** The Fugitive Slave Act, in particular, sparked outrage in the North and contributed to the rise of the abolitionist movement.
* **Failure to address the core issue of slavery:** The compromise merely postponed the inevitable confrontation over slavery.
* **Rise of sectional parties:** The compromise led to the formation of the Free Soil Party in the North and the Know-Nothing Party, which opposed the influx of immigrants from Catholic countries.
* **Contributed to the outbreak of the Civil War:** The Compromise of 1850 ultimately failed to prevent the Civil War, as the issue of slavery remained unresolved.
