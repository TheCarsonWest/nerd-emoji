# ID: Dred Scott v. Sandford 

## When:  1857

## Who: 
* Dred Scott, an enslaved man
* John Sanford, Scott's owner 
* The Supreme Court of the United States (Chief Justice Roger Taney)

## What:
A landmark Supreme Court case in which Dred Scott, an enslaved man who had lived in free states and territories, sued for his freedom. The court ruled against Scott, declaring that:
*  Blacks, whether free or enslaved, were not considered citizens and therefore had no right to sue in federal court.
* The Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, meaning Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories.

## Impact: Why Significant?
The Dred Scott decision had a profound impact on the United States, significantly escalating tensions between North and South. 
* **Reinforced the idea of racial inequality** by denying citizenship to African Americans.
* **Fueled the Abolitionist movement** and intensified calls for the end of slavery.
* **Furthered the divide between North and South**, as Northerners saw the decision as a victory for slavery, while Southerners viewed it as a validation of their rights.
* **Contributed to the outbreak of the Civil War** as it essentially declared that the federal government could not restrict the expansion of slavery.
