# ID: [[Kansas]]-[[Nebraska Act]] 
## When: May 30, 1854
## Who: Stephen Douglas (Senator from [[Illinois]]) 
## What: 
The [[Kansas]]-[[Nebraska Act]] was a controversial piece of legislation that allowed for the potential creation of two new states, [[Kansas]] and [[Nebraska]], with the question of slavery to be determined by [[popular sovereignty]] (allowing the residents of each territory to vote on whether or not to allow slavery). 
## Impact: Why Significant?: 
This act effectively repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820 which prohibited slavery north of the 36°30′ parallel. This angered many in the North, leading to increased tensions between the North and South. It also sparked a violent struggle in [[Kansas]], known as "[[Bleeding Kansas]]," as pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions clashed. The [[Kansas]]-[[Nebraska Act]] is seen as a major factor in the escalation of sectional tensions that ultimately led to the [[Civil War]].
