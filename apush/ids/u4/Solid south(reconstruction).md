## ID: Solid South (Reconstruction)

## When: 1877 - 1900 (Post-Reconstruction Era)

## Who: 
* Southern White [[Democrats]] 
* Former Confederate Leaders 
* White Southerners 

## What: 
The "Solid South" refers to the formerly Confederate states that, after Reconstruction, became unified in their political support for the [[Democrats]].  This was due to a combination of factors, including: 
* **White Supremacy:**  Southern whites sought to maintain their social and economic dominance over African Americans, using tactics like Jim Crow laws and voter suppression.
* **Economic Interests:** The [[Democrats]] often aligned with Southern economic interests, particularly those tied to agriculture and the sharecropping system.
* **Opposition to Federal Intervention:** Southerners resented federal intervention in their affairs, especially during Reconstruction.

## Impact: Why Significant? 
The "Solid South" solidified a system of racial segregation and disenfranchisement in the South, lasting for decades. This had several major impacts:
* **Limited African American Political Power:**  Black voters were effectively excluded from the political process, weakening their ability to advocate for their rights.
* **Perpetuation of Inequality:**  The South became a region of persistent poverty and limited economic opportunity for African Americans.
* **National Divide:** The "Solid South" became a significant factor in national political divisions, particularly on issues of race and civil rights. 
* **Legacy of Segregation:**  The "Solid South" solidified a racial caste system that was eventually overturned by the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s.
