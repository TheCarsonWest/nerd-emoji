# ID: Jim Crow Laws
## When: 1877-1965 (Post-Reconstruction Era) 
## Who:  
Southern White [[Democrats]] (primarily, but some Black people were involved in the system as well) 
## What:
A system of state and local laws enacted in the Southern and some border states of the United States between 1877 and the mid-1960s. These laws were designed to disenfranchise and segregate African Americans. They included:
* **Voting Restrictions:** Poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and white primaries. 
* **Segregation:** Separate public facilities (schools, restrooms, transportation, etc.)
* **Economic Disparities:**  Limited employment opportunities, sharecropping, and unequal access to resources. 
* **Violence and Intimidation:** Lynching, mob violence, and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan.
## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Perpetuation of Racial Inequality:** Jim Crow laws solidified racial segregation and inequality in the South. They denied African Americans basic rights and opportunities, undermining the gains made during Reconstruction.
* **Suppression of Black Political Power:** These laws effectively disenfranchise Black voters and prevented them from participating in the political process.
* **Rise of Civil Rights Movement:**  The enduring injustices of Jim Crow laws fueled the Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th century, which ultimately led to the passage of landmark legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
* **Long-Lasting Legacy:** Even after the legal dismantling of Jim Crow, its legacy of racial disparities in areas like education, healthcare, and criminal justice continues to impact the United States today.
