## ID: [[Treaty of Versailles]]

## When: June 28, 1919 (Signed)

## Who:
* **[[Allied Powers]]:** Primarily [[France]] (Georges Clemenceau), Britain (David Lloyd George), and the [[United States]] ([[Woodrow Wilson]])
* **[[Central Powers]]:** Primarily Germany (forced to accept the terms)

## What:
A peace treaty signed at the end of World War I.  It imposed harsh penalties on Germany, including territorial losses, demilitarization, and significant reparations payments.  It also created the [[League of Nations]], an international organization intended to prevent future wars.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **German Resentment:**  The treaty created deep resentment in Germany due to the perceived unfairness and severity of the terms, which contributed to the rise of extremist ideologies like [[Nazism]] in the 1930s.
* **[[League of Nations]]:** The creation of the [[League of Nations]] was intended to foster international cooperation and prevent future wars, but the US Senate refused to ratify the Treaty and join the League, weakening its effectiveness.
* **Seeds of WWII:** Many historians argue that the [[Treaty of Versailles]], with its punitive measures against Germany, contributed significantly to the conditions that led to World War II.
* **US Isolationism:** The US Senate's rejection of the treaty reflected a desire for isolationism and a reluctance to become entangled in European affairs.
* **New Nations:** The treaty led to the creation of new nations and redefined borders in Europe based on self-determination, though these changes were often fraught with ethnic and political tensions.

## ID: [[League of Nations]]

## When: Established January 10, 1920

## Who:
* **Proposed by:** [[Woodrow Wilson]]
* **Key Members (Initially):** [[Great Britain]], [[France]], Italy, Japan (US never joined)

## What:
An international organization formed after World War I to promote peace and cooperation among nations. It aimed to prevent future wars through diplomacy, arbitration, and collective security.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **US Absence:** The [[United States]]' failure to join significantly weakened the League's power and credibility. Isolationist sentiment in the US Senate prevented ratification of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and US membership.
* **Weakness in Preventing Aggression:**  The League proved largely ineffective in preventing aggression in the 1930s, such as Japan's invasion of Manchuria and Italy's invasion of Ethiopia.
* **Precursor to the UN:** Served as a model for the United Nations after World War II, incorporating lessons learned from the League's failures.
* **International Cooperation:** While ultimately unsuccessful in its primary goal, the League did foster some international cooperation on issues like health, labor standards, and refugee assistance.
* **Idealistic Goal:**  The League represented an idealistic attempt to create a system of collective security, reflecting the widespread desire to avoid another global conflict.
