## ID: [[Fourteen Points]]

## When: January 8, 1918

## Who: 
* **[[Woodrow Wilson]]:** President of the [[United States]]

## What: 
* A statement of principles for peace that was to be used for peace negotiations after World War I. Delivered as a speech to Congress.
* Key provisions included:
    * Open diplomacy (no secret treaties)
    * Freedom of the seas
    * Removal of economic barriers (free trade)
    * Reduction of armaments
    * Adjustment of colonial claims (self-determination)
    * Establishment of a "general association of nations" ([[League of Nations]])

## Impact: Why Significant?: 
* **Idealistic Vision:** Wilson's vision was seen as highly idealistic and aimed to create a lasting peace and prevent future wars.
* **European Support (Initially):** The points initially garnered widespread support in Europe, particularly among war-weary populations who yearned for an end to the conflict.
* **Failed to be Fully Implemented:** Many of the [[Fourteen Points]] were compromised or ignored during the [[Treaty of Versailles]] negotiations by Allied powers focused on punishing Germany.
* **[[League of Nations]] Controversy:** The most significant impact was the creation of the [[League of Nations]], which Wilson believed was essential for maintaining peace. However, the U.S. Senate ultimately refused to ratify the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and join the [[League of Nations]] due to concerns about entangling alliances and loss of sovereignty. Isolationist sentiment was strong.
* **Set the Stage for Future Conflicts:** The failure to fully implement the [[Fourteen Points]] and the absence of the U.S. from the [[League of Nations]] weakened the organization and contributed to the instability of the interwar period, ultimately setting the stage for World War II.
* **Influence on Future Diplomacy:** Despite its failures at Versailles, the [[Fourteen Points]] had a lasting impact on diplomatic thought, promoting concepts such as self-determination, open diplomacy, and international cooperation.
