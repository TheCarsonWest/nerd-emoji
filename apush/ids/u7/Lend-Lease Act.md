## ID: [[Lend-Lease Act]]

## When: March 11, 1941

## Who:
* **[[United States]]:** [[Franklin D]]. Roosevelt (President) and the US Congress
* **Allied Nations (primarily):** [[Great Britain]], Soviet Union, China

## What:
A program enacted by the US Congress that allowed the [[United States]] to provide military aid (weapons, food, equipment) to Allied nations during World War II *without* requiring immediate payment. Essentially, the US would "lend" or "lease" supplies to countries whose defense was deemed vital to the security of the [[United States]]. It was designed to circumvent the Neutrality Acts.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Shift from Neutrality:** Represented a significant departure from the official US policy of neutrality, moving the nation closer to active involvement in WWII.
* **Economic Support for Allies:** Provided crucial economic and material support to [[Great Britain]] (which was nearing bankruptcy), the Soviet Union (after Germany invaded), and other Allied nations, helping them resist Axis aggression.
* **"Arsenal of Democracy":** Allowed the US to become the "arsenal of democracy," producing vast amounts of war materials to support the Allied war effort, boosting the American economy and industry.
* **Undeclared Naval War:** German submarines targeted ships delivering Lend-Lease aid, leading to increasing tensions and undeclared naval warfare between the US and Germany *before* the attack on Pearl Harbor.
* **Post-War Debt & Influence:** Created a complex web of debts and obligations after the war, which further solidified the US's position as a global superpower.
* **Path to US Entry into WWII:** The act signaled a clear US commitment to the Allied cause and paved the way for the nation's full-scale entry into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
