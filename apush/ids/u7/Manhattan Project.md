## ID: [[Manhattan Project]]

## WHEN: 1942-1946 (Peak Activity: 1942-1945)

## WHO:
*   **Key Scientists:** [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] (scientific director), Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Albert Einstein (wrote letter urging action)
*   **Military Leadership:** General Leslie Groves (military director)
*   **Government:** President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], President [[Harry S. Truman]]
*   **Participating Nations:** [[United States]], United Kingdom, Canada

## WHAT:
A top-secret research and development project during World War II that produced the first atomic bombs. It involved numerous research facilities across the [[United States]] (Los Alamos, NM; Oak Ridge, TN; Hanford, WA), Canada, and the United Kingdom. The project was initiated out of fear that Nazi Germany was developing similar weapons. It culminated in the creation of two atomic bombs: "Little Boy" (uranium-based) and "Fat Man" (plutonium-based).

## IMPACT: Why Significant?:
*   **End of WWII in the Pacific:** The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima (August 6, 1945) and Nagasaki (August 9, 1945) led to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.
*   **Beginning of the Nuclear Age:** Ushered in a new era of warfare and global politics defined by the existence of nuclear weapons.
*   **Cold War:** The development and use of atomic weapons initiated the nuclear arms race between the [[United States]] and the Soviet Union, a key aspect of the Cold War.
*   **Ethical Concerns:** Raised profound ethical questions about the use of such devastating weapons and the responsibility of scientists in developing them.
*   **Nuclear Proliferation:** Led to concerns about the spread of nuclear weapons to other nations and the potential for nuclear war.
*   **Increased Government Funding for Science:** Demonstrated the power of scientific research and led to increased government funding for scientific endeavors, especially in areas related to national defense.
