## When: May 1933 (created as part of the New Deal)

## Who: 
* **President Franklin Delano Roosevelt** (FDR) and the US Congress

## What: 

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was a federally owned corporation created to provide navigation, flood control, electricity generation, fertilizer manufacturing, and economic development to the Tennessee Valley, a region particularly affected by the Great Depression.  The TVA built dams, power plants, and other infrastructure to modernize the region and improve the quality of life for its residents.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Regional Development:** The TVA brought electricity to rural areas of the Tennessee Valley, stimulating economic growth and industrial development. It also provided jobs and improved living standards for many people in the region.
* **Flood Control:** The TVA's dam system helped control flooding along the Tennessee River, protecting farmland and communities from devastating floods.
* **Navigation:**  The TVA improved river navigation, making it easier and cheaper to transport goods and resources throughout the region.
* **Government Intervention:** The TVA represented a significant expansion of the federal government's role in economic development and regional planning. It demonstrated the potential for government-led initiatives to address social and economic problems. 
* **Environmental Impact:**  While the TVA brought many benefits, it also had some negative environmental consequences, including the displacement of communities due to dam construction and alterations to natural river ecosystems.  This sparked debate about the balance between economic development and environmental protection.
* **Long-term Significance:** The TVA serves as a model for large-scale regional development projects and continues to provide electricity and other services to the Tennessee Valley today.
