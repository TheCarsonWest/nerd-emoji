## ID: [[Treaty of Versailles]]

## When: June 28, 1919

## Who: 
*   **[[Allied Powers]]:** Primarily [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and the [[United States]] (though the US Senate ultimately rejected the treaty)
*   **[[Central Powers]]:** Germany (forced to accept the terms)
*   **President [[Woodrow Wilson]]:** Advocate for the [[League of Nations]], but ultimately unsuccessful in securing US ratification of the Treaty.

## What: 

The peace treaty that officially ended World War I. It imposed harsh terms on Germany, including territorial losses, disarmament, and massive reparations payments. It also established the [[League of Nations]].

## Impact: Why Significant?: 
*   **German Resentment:** The treaty's harsh terms fostered resentment and economic hardship in Germany, creating fertile ground for extremist ideologies like [[Nazism]].
*   **[[League of Nations]]:** Created the [[League of Nations]], an international organization designed to prevent future wars. However, the US Senate's refusal to ratify the treaty weakened the League from its inception.
*   **Seeds of WWII:** Many historians argue that the [[Treaty of Versailles]], by creating instability and resentment in Europe, contributed to the outbreak of World War II.
*   **US Isolationism:** The US Senate's rejection of the treaty reflected a growing sentiment of isolationism and a reluctance to become entangled in European affairs.
*   **New Nations:** Redrew the map of Europe, leading to the creation of several new nations, some of which would later become sources of conflict.
