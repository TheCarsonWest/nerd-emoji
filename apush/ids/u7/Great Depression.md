## ID: [[Great Depression]]

## WHEN: 1929-1939

## WHO: 
*   **Affected:** The [[Great Depression]] affected virtually every American, with disproportionate impact on farmers, industrial workers, and African Americans.
*   **Presidents:** [[Herbert Hoover]] (initial response), [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ([[New Deal]])
*   **Economists:** Influential economists of the time included John Maynard Keynes, whose theories influenced [[New Deal]] policies.

## WHAT: 

A severe worldwide economic downturn that began with the stock market crash on **October 29, 1929** (Black Tuesday). It was characterized by widespread unemployment, bank failures, business closures, deflation, and a decline in international trade. Factors contributing to the depression included overproduction, unequal distribution of wealth, high tariffs, and a lack of regulation in the financial industry.

## IMPACT: Why Significant?: 

*   **Economic Devastation:** The [[Great Depression]] led to widespread poverty and hardship. Unemployment reached 25% and many people lost their homes and farms.
*   **Shift in Government Role:** The crisis prompted a significant expansion of the federal government's role in the economy. The [[New Deal]] programs initiated by FDR aimed to provide relief, recovery, and reform.
*   **Social and Psychological Effects:**  The Depression profoundly impacted American society, leading to increased stress, displacement, and altered social structures. It also fostered a sense of disillusionment and distrust in institutions.
*   **Political Realignment:** The Depression led to a major political realignment, with the Democratic Party gaining significant support from labor unions, farmers, and minorities.
*   **Long-Term Reforms:** The [[Great Depression]] led to lasting reforms in the financial system, including the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
*   **WWII as an Ending Factor:** While [[New Deal]] programs helped alleviate some of the suffering, full economic recovery was not achieved until the onset of World War II, when increased demand for war materials stimulated production and employment.
