## ID: [[Nazism]]

## WHEN: 1920s-1945 (Rise to power in the 1930s, height of power during WWII, defeated in 1945)

## WHO: 
* **Key Figure:** Adolf Hitler (Leader of the Nazi Party and Chancellor/Führer of Germany)
* **Nazi Party:** A far-right political party in Germany founded in the aftermath of World War I. Composed of followers like Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, etc.
* **German People:** Supported/tolerated the Nazi regime for various reasons (economic recovery, national pride, fear).

## WHAT: 

A far-right, racist, and antisemitic ideology and political movement that dominated Germany from 1933 to 1945. It was based on extreme nationalism, racial superiority (specifically of the "Aryan" race), and a totalitarian form of government. Key tenets included:
* **Racial Purity:** Belief in a superior "Aryan" race and the need to eliminate "inferior" races, especially Jews (culminating in the [[Holocaust]]).
* **Antisemitism:** Intense hatred and persecution of Jewish people.
* **Totalitarianism:** A single-party dictatorial state controlling all aspects of life (political, economic, social, cultural).
* **Aggressive Expansionism:** Desire to expand Germany's territory and influence through military conquest ("Lebensraum" - living space).
* **Propaganda and Indoctrination:** Heavy use of propaganda to control public opinion and instill Nazi ideology.

## IMPACT: Why Significant?:
* **World War II:** Nazi aggression and expansionist policies directly led to the outbreak of World War II in Europe, a global conflict that caused immense destruction and loss of life.
* **The [[Holocaust]]:** The Nazi regime systematically murdered approximately six million Jews in concentration camps and through other forms of persecution. This genocide is considered one of the worst atrocities in human history.
* **Defeat of Germany:** The Allied powers defeated Nazi Germany in 1945, ending the regime and exposing its horrific crimes to the world.
* **Nuremberg Trials:** Nazi leaders were put on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity, setting a precedent for international law and the prosecution of genocide.
* **Impact on US:**
    * **Entry into WWII:** Nazi aggression and the attack on Pearl Harbor prompted the US to enter World War II.
    * **War Production:** The US economy was transformed by the war effort, leading to industrial growth and the end of the [[Great Depression]].
    * **Post-War World Order:** The US emerged as a global superpower after the war, playing a key role in shaping the post-war international order and containing the spread of communism. The lessons learned from the rise of [[Nazism]] influenced the creation of the United Nations and other international organizations aimed at preventing future conflicts and promoting human rights.
    * **Civil Rights Movement:** The hypocrisy of fighting for freedom abroad while denying rights to African Americans at home fueled the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the US.
