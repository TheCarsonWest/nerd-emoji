## ID: [[Return to Normalcy]]

## WHEN: 1920 (Specifically following World War I)

## WHO: President [[Warren G]]. Harding

## WHAT:

"[[Return to Normalcy]]" was [[Warren G]]. Harding's presidential campaign slogan in 1920. It represented a desire to go back to the way life was before World War I and the Progressive Era. This meant a focus on domestic issues, less government intervention in the economy, and a retreat from international affairs. It included policies that supported business growth, limited immigration, and promoted traditional values. It was a rejection of Wilsonian idealism and the social reforms of the previous decades.

## IMPACT:

*   **Electoral Victory:** The slogan resonated with a war-weary public, contributing significantly to Harding's landslide victory in the 1920 election.
*   **Shift in Political Focus:** Signaled a shift away from Progressive Era reforms and international involvement towards pro-business policies and isolationism. This marked a more conservative era in American politics.
*   **Economic Growth:** Harding's policies, such as lower taxes and reduced regulation, contributed to the economic boom of the "Roaring Twenties."
*   **Isolationism:** The "[[Return to Normalcy]]" reinforced American isolationist tendencies, leading to reluctance to join the [[League of Nations]] and a focus on domestic affairs.
* **End of an Era:** The Era of Progressive reform had ended and America had entered a new era of prosperity that was exclusive and favored business.
