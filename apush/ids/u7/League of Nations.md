## ID: [[League of Nations]]

## When: 1920 (Established); Proposed in 1918 (Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]])

## Who: 
* **Initiator:** U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (though the US ultimately did *not* join)
* **Key Members (Initially):** [[Great Britain]], [[France]], Italy, Japan (Excluded: Germany and Russia)
* **Opponents in the US:** Isolationist Senators (led by Henry Cabot Lodge)

## What: 

An international organization established after World War I under the [[Treaty of Versailles]].  It was designed to promote international cooperation and peace by preventing future wars through diplomacy, arbitration, and collective security. Member nations pledged to protect each other's independence and territorial integrity.

## Impact: Why Significant?: 
* **US Failure to Join:** Despite Wilson's advocacy, the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and therefore did not join the [[League of Nations]]. This was largely due to concerns about entangling alliances and the potential loss of U.S. sovereignty, championed by figures like Henry Cabot Lodge and the "Irreconcilables".
* **Weakened Organization:**  The absence of the [[United States]], a major world power, significantly weakened the League's authority and effectiveness.  It lacked both the economic and military might to effectively enforce its decisions.
* **Ineffectiveness in Preventing Aggression:**  The League proved largely ineffective in preventing aggression by totalitarian powers during the 1930s (e.g., Japan's invasion of Manchuria, Italy's invasion of Ethiopia, Hitler's expansionist policies). Its policy of appeasement failed to deter these actions.
* **Foundation for Future Organizations:** While largely a failure, the [[League of Nations]] served as a precursor to the United Nations (UN), providing a framework and lessons learned for future international cooperation efforts. The UN was designed to address the weaknesses of the League.
* **Debate on US Foreign Policy:**  The debate surrounding the [[League of Nations]] reflected the deep divisions within the [[United States]] regarding its role in world affairs - isolationism versus interventionism - which would continue to shape US foreign policy for decades.
