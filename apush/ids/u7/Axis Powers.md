## ID: [[Axis Powers]]

## When: 1930s-1945 (Specifically formalized in 1936 with the Anti-Comintern Pact and cemented by the Tripartite Pact in 1940)

## Who: 
*   **Germany:** Adolf Hitler, Nazi Party

## What: 

A military alliance that opposed the Allied powers during World War II. The core members were Germany, Italy, and Japan. These nations shared a common ideology of aggressive expansionism, militarism, and authoritarianism. They aimed to establish their dominance over various regions of the world, violating international treaties and engaging in acts of aggression. Germany sought to dominate Europe, Italy aimed for a new Roman Empire in the Mediterranean, and Japan desired control of East Asia and the Pacific.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
*   **Trigger for WWII:** The Axis powers' aggressive expansion and violation of international agreements directly led to the outbreak of World War II in both Europe and Asia.
*   **Global Conflict:**  Their actions resulted in a global war that engulfed numerous nations, causing immense destruction, death, and suffering.
*   **Ideological Conflict:** The conflict represented a major ideological clash between democracy/liberalism (Allied powers) and fascism/totalitarianism (Axis powers).
*   **[[Holocaust]] and Atrocities:** The Axis powers, particularly Nazi Germany, were responsible for widespread atrocities, including the [[Holocaust]], the systematic extermination of Jews and other minority groups.  Japan committed severe war crimes in Asia, including the Nanking Massacre.
*   **Post-War World Order:** The defeat of the Axis powers led to a significant shift in the global balance of power, the rise of the [[United States]] and the Soviet Union as superpowers, and the formation of the United Nations to prevent future conflicts. The collapse of the Axis powers led to major trials such as the Nuremberg Trials, holding many people accountable for their war crimes.
