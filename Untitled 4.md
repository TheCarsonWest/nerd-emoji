Lyndon Johnson's presidency was significantly hurt by:

1.  **The Vietnam War:** The escalating involvement in Vietnam consumed vast resources, both financial and human, and deeply divided American society. Protests against the war grew, eroding public support for Johnson and his policies.

2.  **Social Unrest and Division:** While Johnson championed civil rights legislation, the era was also marked by significant social unrest, including race riots and widespread protests. This division within the country, combined with the controversies surrounding the Vietnam War, made it difficult for Johnson to maintain a unified base of support and effectively govern.
