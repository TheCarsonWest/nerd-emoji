**Summary of the Articles of Confederation**

The Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, served as the first constitution of the United States. It established a loose confederation of independent states, which retained most of their power.

**Central Points:**

* **Weak central government:** The Articles created a unicameral Congress with limited powers, including the ability to declare war, make treaties, and borrow money.
* **State sovereignty:** States retained their independence and could veto any act of Congress.
* **No executive or judicial branches:** The Articles did not establish a president, cabinet, or federal courts.
* **Unanimous consent required:** Amendments to the Articles required the approval of all 13 states.

**Achievements:**

* **Established a framework for a national government:** Despite its weaknesses, the Articles provided a basis for the later Constitution.
* **Facilitated cooperation among states:** The Articles helped to coordinate the war effort against Great Britain.

**Failures:**

* **Ineffective central government:** The weak Congress struggled to raise funds, regulate commerce, and resolve disputes between states.
* **Lack of executive authority:** Without a president, there was no one to enforce the laws or represent the nation abroad.
* **Excessive state power:** The states' ability to veto federal actions made it difficult for the national government to function effectively.
* **Economic instability:** The Articles did not provide for a national currency or regulate trade, leading to economic chaos.
* **Inability to address international threats:** The weak central government was unable to protect the United States from foreign powers, such as the Barbary pirates.
