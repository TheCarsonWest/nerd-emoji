**Atmosphere**

* **Gases:**
    * Nitrogen (78%)
    * Oxygen (21%)
    * Argon (0.93%)
    * Carbon dioxide (0.04%)
    * Water vapor (0-4%)

* **Layers:**
    * Exosphere: Merges with space
    * Thermosphere: Absorbs harmful radiation, produces northern lights
    * Mesosphere: Middle layer
    * Stratosphere: Contains ozone layer, absorbs UV radiation
    * Troposphere: Weather occurs, most dense layer

* **Temperature Gradient:**
    * Thermosphere: Temperature increases due to solar radiation
    * Mesosphere: Temperature decreases due to low density
    * Stratosphere: Temperature increases due to UV absorption
    * Troposphere: Temperature decreases with altitude
