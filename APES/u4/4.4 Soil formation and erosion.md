**Soil Formation and Erosion**

**Soil Components:**
- Geologic (rock): sand, silt, clay
- Organic (living): humus (decomposed biomass), nutrients, water, air, organisms

**Soil Formation:**
- Weathering breaks down rocks into smaller fragments forming soil.
- Erosion transports weathered fragments away.
- Deposition adds soil particles from other areas.

**Soil Horizons:**
- O-Horizon: Organic matter
- A-Horizon (topsoil): Humus and minerals
- B-Horizon (subsoil): Minerals
- C-Horizon: Least weathered, close to parent material

**Soil Erosion:**
- Transport of weathered fragments by wind and rain.
- Deposition: Fragments carried to new locations and settled.

**Soil Degradation:**
- Loss of topsoil: Tilling, loss of vegetation
- Compaction: Compression of soil
- Nutrient depletion: Repeated crop growth
