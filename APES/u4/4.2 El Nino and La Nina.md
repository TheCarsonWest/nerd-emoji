**El Nino and La Nina**

**El Nino:**
* Reversal of trade winds, bringing warm water to the west coast of the Americas
* Suppressed upwelling, leading to:
    * Reduced fisheries productivity in South America
    * Flooding in the Americas (especially the west coast)
* Increased precipitation and drought in Australia and Southeast Asia
* Other effects:
    * Weakened hurricane activity in the Atlantic
    * Decreased monsoon activity in India and Southeast Asia

**La Nina:**
* Intensified trade winds, bringing cool water to the west coast of the Americas
* Increased upwelling, leading to:
    * Enhanced fisheries productivity in South America
    * Cooler and drier weather in the Americas
* Warmer and rainier weather in Australia and Southeast Asia
* Other effects:
    * Increased hurricane activity in the Atlantic
    * Increased monsoon activity in India and Southeast Asia
