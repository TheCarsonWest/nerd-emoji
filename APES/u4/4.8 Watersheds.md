**Watersheds**

* Land that drains into a specific water body.
* Determined by slope and geography.
* Vegetation, soil, and slope influence drainage patterns.

**Chesapeake Bay Watershed**

* Region that drains into Chesapeake Bay.
* Mix of fresh and salt water creates productive estuary habitats.
* Provides ecosystem services such as tourism revenue, water filtration, and storm protection.

**Human Impacts on Chesapeake Bay**

* Nutrient pollution (nitrogen and phosphorus) leads to eutrophication.
* Sources of nutrients: sewage treatment plants, animal waste, fertilizers.
* Other pollutants: endocrine disruptors, sediment pollution.

**Effects of Clearcutting on Watersheds**

* Soil erosion: loss of root structure destabilizes soil, leading to sediment deposition in streams.
* Increased soil and stream temperatures: loss of tree shade reduces albedo and increases sunlight absorption.
* Flooding and landslides: compacted soil and reduced water retention capacity increase runoff and instability.
