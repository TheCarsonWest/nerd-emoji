**Global Wind Patterns**

**Objectives:**

* Understand the factors that drive wind patterns.
* Explain the Coriolis effect.

**Factors Driving Wind Patterns:**

* **Energy from Sunlight:** Heats air at the equator, causing it to rise.
* **Density of Air:** Warm air (less dense) rises, while cold air (more dense) sinks.
* **Rotation of Earth (Coriolis Effect):** Deflects moving objects in the atmosphere due to Earth's rotation.

**Air Properties:**

* Warm air holds more moisture.
* Rising air expands and cools, causing moisture to condense (rain).
* Cool air sinks and holds less moisture.

**Global Wind Circulation:**

* Air rises at the equator (0° latitude), creating low pressure.
* Air spreads north and south towards the poles.
* Air descends at 30° north and south, creating high pressure.
* Air moves from high pressure to low pressure, forming wind patterns.

**Coriolis Effect:**

* Deflects wind:
    * To the right in the Northern Hemisphere.
    * To the left in the Southern Hemisphere.

**Wind Belts:**

* 0°-30°: Easterly trade winds (west to east).
* 30°-60°: Westerlies (west to east).
* 60°-90°: Polar winds (west to east).
