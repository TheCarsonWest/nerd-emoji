**Soil Composition and Properties**

**Soil Particles and Texture:**
* Soil particles: Sand > Silt > Clay
* Soil texture: Percentage of sand, silt, and clay
* Sand: Large pores, high porosity
* Clay: Small pores, low porosity

**Porosity and Permeability:**
* Porosity: Pore space within soil
* Permeability: Ability of water to drain through soil
* Positive relationship between porosity and permeability

**Water Holding Capacity:**
* Inverse relationship between porosity/permeability and water holding capacity
* Sandy soils: Drain quickly, low water holding capacity
* Clay soils: Drain slowly, high water holding capacity

**Soil Fertility:**
* Nutrients: N, P, K+, Mg2+, Ca+, Na+
* Organic matter, humus, and clay increase soil nutrients
* Acids, excessive rain, and farming deplete soil nutrients

**Soil Quality Tests:**
* Texture: Measure sand, silt, and clay layers in water
* Permeability: Time for water to drain through soil
* pH: Acidity or alkalinity
* Color: Indicates humus content and nutrient levels
* Nutrient level: Measure specific nutrients (e.g., ammonium, nitrate)
