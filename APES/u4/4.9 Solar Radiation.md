**Solar Radiation & Earth's Seasons**

**Solar Intensity & Latitude**

* Insolation (solar radiation) is greater at the equator than at higher latitudes.
* This is due to the angle at which the sun's rays strike the surface and the amount of atmosphere they pass through.

**Solar Intensity & Season**

* Earth's orbit and tilt on its axis cause the angle of the sun's rays to vary.
* This results in varying insolation and length of daylight, leading to seasons.

**Albedo**

* Albedo is the proportion of light reflected by a surface.
* Surfaces with higher albedo reflect more light and absorb less heat (e.g., ice, snow).
* Surfaces with lower albedo absorb more heat (e.g., water).

**Albedo & Surface Temperature**

* Surface temperature is affected by albedo.
* Areas with lower albedo absorb more heat and are warmer.
* Urban areas are often warmer due to the low albedo of blacktop.
* Polar regions are colder due to the higher albedo of ice and snow.
