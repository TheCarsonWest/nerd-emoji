[[Unit 4]]

* Geography influences climate.
* Mountains:
    * Windward side: moist air rises, causing rain and vegetation.
    * Leeward side: dry air descends, causing arid conditions.
* Oceans:
    * Moderate temperature.
    * Add moisture to air.

**Rain Shadows**

* Eastern trade winds bring moist air from Atlantic across South America.
* Windward side of Andes receives heavy rainfall.
* Leeward side of Andes receives arid air.
* ~30Â° latitude also contributes to lack of rain due to high pressure and descending air.

**Regional Precipitation Pattern in Mexico & Central America**

* Northern Mexico and Central America receive less precipitation due to their higher latitude and distance from the equator.
* The windward side of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains in Mexico receives more precipitation than the leeward side due to the rain shadow effect.
* The Pacific coast of Mexico and Central America receives more precipitation than the interior due to the proximity to the ocean.
