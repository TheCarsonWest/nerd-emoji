**Population Growth & Resource Availability**

**Population Characteristics:**

* Size: Total number of individuals
* Density: Number of individuals per area
* Distribution: Spacing of individuals (random, uniform, clumped)

**Factors Influencing Population Growth:**

* **Density-Dependent Factors:**
    * Affected by population size
    * Examples: Food, habitat competition, disease
* **Density-Independent Factors:**
    * Not affected by population size
    * Examples: Natural disasters

**Biotic Potential:**

* Maximum potential growth rate with no limiting resources
* Exponential growth curve

**Logistic Growth:**

* Initial rapid growth followed by leveling off due to limiting factors
* S-shaped growth curve

**Calculating Population Change:**

* Population Size = (Births + Immigrations) - (Deaths + Emigrations)
