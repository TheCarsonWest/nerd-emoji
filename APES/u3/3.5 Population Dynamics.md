**Human Population Dynamics**

**Malthusian Theory:**

* Earth has a limited carrying capacity for humans.
* Human population growth outpaces food production.
* Technology can increase carrying capacity (e.g., synthetic fertilizer).

**Population Growth Rates:**

* Growth rate (r) = (Birth rate - Death rate) / 10
* Rule of 70: Doubling time = 70 / r

**Factors Affecting Population Growth:**

* Increased TFR, immigration, and reduced death rates increase growth.
* High death rates, infant mortality, development, and education decrease growth.

**Standard of Living Indicators:**

* GDP per capita and life expectancy indicate development and low population growth.

**Environmental Impact and Government Solution:**

* Rapid population growth can strain biodiversity.
* Government could implement policies to slow population growth, such as:
    * Education and family planning programs
    * Economic incentives for smaller families
    * Improved access to healthcare and education for women
