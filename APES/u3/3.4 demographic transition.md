**Demographic Transition Model**

**Pre-industrial Stage (Stage 1):**

* High death and infant mortality rates
* High total fertility rate (TFR)
* Little economic growth

**Industrializing Stage (Stage 2):**

* Declining death and infant mortality rates
* Rising TFR due to lack of education, contraceptives, and need for agricultural labor
* Rapid population growth

**Developed Stage (Stage 3):**

* Very low death and infant mortality rates
* TFR near replacement level (2.1)
* High education and economic development
* Slowing population growth

**Post-Industrialized Stage (Stage 4):**

* Very high per capita GDP and life expectancy
* TFR below replacement level
* Negative population growth due to low birth rates and high contraceptive use
