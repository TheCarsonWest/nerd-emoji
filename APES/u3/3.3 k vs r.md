**K-selected vs. r-selected Species**

**K-selected**

* "Quality" strategy
* Few offspring with heavy parental care
* Long lifespan, low reproductive rate, slow growth rate
* Vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species

**r-selected**

* "Quantity" strategy
* Many offspring with little or no parental care
* Short lifespan, high reproductive rate, fast growth rate
* Better adapted to changing environments and more likely to become invasive

**Spectrum of Parental Care**

* K-selected: high parental care, offspring dependent on parents
* r-selected: low parental care, offspring independent

**Invasiveness and Disturbances**

* High biotic potential (r-selected) allows for rapid population recovery after disturbances.
* Low parental care (r-selected) reduces impact of parent mortality on offspring.
* Invasives (often r-selected) outcompete K-selected species with higher biotic potential and faster population growth.
