**Survivorship Curves**

* **Type I:** K-selected species; high survival rates early in life (parental care), mid-life (large size, defense), and rapid decline in late life (old age).
* **Type II:** Intermediate between r- and K-selected; steadily decreasing survival rates throughout life.
* **Type III:** r-selected species; high mortality early in life (little parental care), slow decline in mid-life, and slow decline in old age.
