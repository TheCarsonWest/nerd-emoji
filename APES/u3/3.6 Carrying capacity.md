**Carrying Capacity**

* Maximum population size an ecosystem can support (limited by resources: food, water, habitat)
* Overshoot: population exceeds carrying capacity, leading to resource depletion
* Die-off: sharp population decline due to resource depletion

**Predator-Prey Interactions**

* Predator population increase leads to prey population decrease
* Prey population decrease leads to predator population decrease
