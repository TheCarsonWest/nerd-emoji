**Biomass vs. Biofuels**

* **Biomass:** Organic matter burned for heat and electricity; common in developing countries.
* **Biofuels:** Liquid fuels made from biomass (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel); used as gasoline substitutes.

**Carbon Neutrality of Biomass**

* Biomass burning releases CO2, but it is considered "carbon neutral" because it is recently sequestered carbon.
* Fossil fuel burning releases carbon that has been stored for millions of years.

**Health and Environmental Consequences of Biomass Burning**

* Releases CO, NOx, PM, and VOCs, which can cause respiratory problems.
* Deforestation, soil erosion, and air pollution.

**Biofuels**

* **Ethanol:** Made from corn or sugar cane; reduces oil consumption but has environmental concerns (e.g., soil erosion, habitat loss).
* **Algae:** Sustainable source of biofuel oils.
* **Biodiesel:** Made from plant oils (e.g., soy, canola, palm); can be more sustainable than corn ethanol if using cleared land.
