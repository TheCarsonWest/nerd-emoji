**Fossil Fuels**

**Combustion:**
- Fossil fuels release energy when burned, releasing CO2 and H2O.
- Coal, oil, natural gas, wood, and biomass all undergo the same combustion process.

**Electricity Generation:**
- Fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, trash) are burned to produce heat.
- Heat turns water into steam, which drives a turbine, which powers a generator to produce electricity.

**Environmental Consequences of Coal:**
- Habitat destruction
- Air pollution (CO2, PM, SOx, NOx)
- Water pollution (toxic ash)

**Environmental Consequences of Tar Sands Oil:**
- Habitat destruction
- Water depletion and contamination
- CO2 emissions

**Environmental Consequences of Crude Oil:**
- Spills (water and land)
- Habitat loss

**Fracking:**
- Horizontal drilling fractures rock layers to extract natural gas.
- Environmental concerns include groundwater contamination, water depletion, seismic activity, and habitat loss.

**Cogeneration:**
- Using heat from electricity generation to provide heat for buildings.
- Increases efficiency of coal and natural gas as fuel sources.
