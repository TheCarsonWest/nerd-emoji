**Nuclear Energy**

**Nuclear Fission and Radioactivity**
* Neutron triggers breakdown of unstable nucleus (e.g., Uranium-235), releasing energy and neutrons (chain reaction).
* Radioactivity: Nucleus emits energy without fission (decay).
* Half-Life: Time for 50% of a radioactive substance to decay.

**Generating Electricity**
* Fission heats water into steam, which turns turbines that generate electricity.
* Control rods regulate reaction rate.
* Water pump and cooling tower maintain reactor temperature.

**Nonrenewable and Cleaner than Fossil Fuels**
* Uranium is limited.
* No air pollutants released during electricity generation, but mining and construction still produce greenhouse gases.

**Drawbacks and Environmental Concerns**
* Potential for meltdowns and radioactive contamination.
* Spent fuel rods remain radioactive for millions of years.
* Mine tailings can contaminate water and soil.
* Water depletion.
* Water vapor released from cooling towers (a greenhouse gas).
* Thermal pollution in surface waters.

**Nuclear Meltdowns**
* Three Mile Island (US), Fukushima (Japan), and Chernobyl (Ukraine) are notable cases.
* Environmental consequences include genetic mutations, cancer, and contaminated soil.
* Radiation can spread over long distances.
