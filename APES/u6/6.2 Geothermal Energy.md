**Geothermal Energy**

**Basics:**

* Heat from Earth's core drives convection currents that release heat near the surface.
* Water can be heated underground and converted to steam to generate electricity or heat buildings.

**Ground Source Heat Pump (not technically geothermal):**

* Heat-absorbing fluid is circulated underground to extract or release heat to the ground.
* Ground maintains a consistent temperature (50-60Â°F) at shallow depths.

**True Geothermal Heating:**

* Water is piped deep into the ground to be heated by magma.
* Heated water is used to heat buildings.

**Pros:**

* Renewable (if water is returned).
* No greenhouse gas emissions.
* Lower CO2 emissions than fossil fuels.

**Cons:**

* Not universally accessible.
* High drilling costs.
* Potential release of toxic hydrogen sulfide.
