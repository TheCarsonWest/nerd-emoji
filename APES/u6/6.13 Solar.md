**Solar Energy**

**Objectives:** Understand the principles, applications, and environmental implications of solar energy.

**Types of Solar Energy:**

**Passive Solar Energy:**
- Absorbs or blocks sunlight without mechanical/electrical equipment.
- Examples: Solar ovens, building orientation, double-paned windows, deciduous trees.

**Active Solar Energy:**
- Uses mechanical/electrical equipment to capture sunlight.
- Examples: Solar water heaters, photovoltaic cells (PV cells), concentrated solar thermal (CST).

**Photovoltaic Cells (PV)**
- Semiconductor cells (usually silicon) convert sunlight into electricity.
- May power buildings or send excess electricity to the grid.

**Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST)**
- Mirrors reflect sunlight onto a central water tower to produce steam and generate electricity.

**Pros of Solar Energy:**
- No air or greenhouse gas emissions during electricity generation.
- Renewable and abundant source of energy.

**Cons of Solar Energy:**
- Intermittency (only available during daylight hours).
- Habitat loss and fragmentation from solar farms.
- Requires mining of silicon for PV cells.
