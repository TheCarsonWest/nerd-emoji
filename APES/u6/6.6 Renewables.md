**Renewable vs. Nonrenewable Energy**

**Renewable:**
* Replenished naturally at a rate equal to consumption
* Examples: solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal

**Nonrenewable (Depletable):**
* Limited supply on Earth
* Examples: fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), uranium (nuclear)

**Key to Renewable Energy:**
* Rate of consumption must be below the rate of regeneration to ensure sustainability.
