**Hydroelectricity**

**Basics:**
- Converts kinetic energy of moving water into electricity.
- Water flows through turbine, powering generator.
- Largest renewable electricity source globally.

**Water Impoundment (Dams):**
- Dams create reservoirs, allowing control of water flow.
- Provides recreation opportunities, but also floods ecosystems and creates sedimentation.

**Run of River System & Tidal Energy:**
- Diverts river flow through channels to turn turbines.
- Less impactful on ecosystems, but generates less power.
- Tidal power uses ocean flow to turn turbines.

**Drawbacks of Dams:**
- **Ecological:** Floods habitats, prevents fish migration, alters sediment flow.
- **Environmental:** Emits GHGs during construction, increases evaporation, releases methane.
- **Economic:** Requires relocation of homes, expensive construction, sediment removal.

**Fish Ladders:**
- Enable fish to bypass dams for migration.

**Benefits of Dams:**
- **Renewable:** No GHG emissions during electricity generation.
- **Reliable:** Provides electricity for surrounding areas.
- **Flood control:** Prevents flooding downstream.
- **Recreation:** Reservoirs attract tourists.
