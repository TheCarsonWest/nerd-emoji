**Hydrogen Fuel Cells**

**Basics:**

* Use hydrogen gas (H2) as a fuel source.
* Combine H2 with oxygen (O2) to produce electricity and water vapor as a byproduct.

**Creating Hydrogen Gas:**

* Steam reforming (energy-intensive, emits CO2)
* Electrolysis (sustainable, requires electricity)

**Pros of Hydrogen Fuel Cells:**

* Renewable and alternative fuel source.
* No air pollutants emitted from fuel cells.
* Can be used as a vehicle fuel or energy carrier.
* High efficiency (80%).

**Drawbacks:**

* Most hydrogen production relies on non-renewable fossil fuels.
* Electrolysis requires a sustainable electricity source.
* Requires a widespread hydrogen distribution network.
* Storage in vehicles requires large tanks (for gas form).
