**Energy Conservation**

* **Small Scale:** Lowering thermostat, using native plants, efficient appliances, improving insulation
* **Large Scale:** Fuel efficiency standards, electric vehicles, public transport, green building design

**Sustainable Home Design**

* **Passive Solar Design:** Using sun's heat to reduce energy use
* **Insulation:** Trapping heat/cool air for efficiency
* **Landscaping:** Deciduous trees for shade and biodiversity

**Water Conservation**

* **Low-Flow Fixtures:** Using less water for tasks
* **Rain Barrels:** Collecting rainwater for non-potable use
* **Native Plants:** Requiring less watering and supporting biodiversity

**Energy Conservation in Transportation**

* **Improving Fuel Economy:** Reducing gasoline/diesel consumption
* **Hybrids:** Combining gasoline and electric engines for higher MPG
* **Electric Vehicles:** No gasoline use, but require sustainable electricity sources
* **Public Transit/Carpooling:** Energy-efficient transportation options

**Sustainable Building Design**

* **Natural Lighting/Recycled Materials:** Reducing energy consumption
* **Green Roofs/Walls:** Absorbing heat and reducing runoff

**Managing Peak Demand**

* **Variable Price Models:** Incentivizing lower energy use during peak times
* **Smart Grid:** Managing demand and integrating renewable energy sources
