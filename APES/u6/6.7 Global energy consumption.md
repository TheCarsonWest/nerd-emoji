**Global Energy Consumption**

* Developed nations use more energy per person and overall.
* Developing nations are increasing energy use as they industrialize and populations grow.

**Fossil Fuels Dominate**

* Oil, coal, and natural gas are the primary sources of global energy.
* Hydroelectric power is the second largest source.
* Nuclear power ranks third.

**Development and Fossil Fuel Consumption**

* Economic development leads to increased fossil fuel consumption for transportation, electricity, and manufacturing.
* This increases energy use per person in developing nations.

**Factors Affecting Energy Source Use**

* Price fluctuations depend on reserve availability.
* Government regulations can influence energy source mixes (e.g., renewable energy mandates).
* Government policies (e.g., taxes, rebates) can incentivize or discourage specific energy sources.
