**Fuel Types and Uses**

**Subsistence Fuels:**

* Wood: Common in developing nations, inexpensive, but can lead to deforestation.
* Peat: Partially decomposed organic matter, used for heating or cooking.
* Charcoal: Wood heated under low oxygen for extended periods.

**Fossil Fuels:**

**Coal:**

* In order of energy density: lignite, bituminous, anthracite.
* Formation: Peat compacted by pressure from overlying rocks.
* Used to generate electricity through steam turbines.

**Natural Gas:**

* Mostly methane, found above oil deposits.
* Considered "cleanest" fossil fuel, emitting fewer pollutants and CO2.

**Crude Oil (Petroleum):**

* Extracted from underground deposits by drilling.
* Converted into various products through fractional distillation:
    * Petroleum gas
    * Gasoline
    * Naphtha (plastic)
    * Jet fuel
    * Diesel fuel
    * Motor oil
    * Bitumen (asphalt)
