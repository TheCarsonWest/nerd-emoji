**6.4 Wind**

**Wind Energy**

* Kinetic energy of wind spins a turbine, which generates electricity.
* Wind turbines require 8-55 mph winds to generate electricity.
* Motorized drive can turn the turbine to face the wind.
* Wind turbines are often clustered in wind projects or farms for ease of maintenance and transmission line construction.

**Benefits of Wind Energy:**

* Non-depletable
* No GHG emissions or air pollutants
* Can share land uses

**Drawbacks of Wind Energy:**

* Intermittent (not always available)
* Can kill birds and bats
* Can be considered an eyesore or source of noise pollution

**Environmental Benefit of Switching to Wind Energy:**

* Reduced air pollution (no GHG emissions or air pollutants)
