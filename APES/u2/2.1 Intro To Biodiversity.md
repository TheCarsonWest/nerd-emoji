**Biodiversity** is the variety of life on Earth, measured at three levels:

1. **Genetic Diversity:** Variation in genes within a species (population).
2. **Species Diversity:** Number of different species in an ecosystem and their population balance.
3. **Ecosystem Diversity:** Number of different habitats within an area.

**Higher biodiversity leads to healthier ecosystems and populations.**

**Species Richness & Evenness:**

- **Richness:** Total number of species in an ecosystem (more is generally better).
- **Evenness:** How balanced the population sizes are among species (more evenness is better).

**Importance of Genetic Diversity:**

- Mutations and sexual reproduction create genetic variation.
- More genetic variation allows populations to adapt to environmental challenges.

**Threats to Genetic Diversity:**

- **Bottleneck Events:** Drastic population reductions decrease variation.
- **Inbreeding Depression:** Mating with close relatives reduces variation and increases harmful mutations (smaller populations are more at risk).

**Ecosystem Resilience:**

- The ability of an ecosystem to bounce back from disturbances.
- Higher species diversity leads to higher resilience (more species to rebuild the ecosystem)
