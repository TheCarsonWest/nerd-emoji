**2.5 Disruptions**

**Natural Disruptions:**

* Disrupt ecosystem structure and function (e.g., tornadoes, forest fires).
* Occur periodically (e.g., dry-wet seasons), episodically (e.g., hurricanes), or randomly (e.g., earthquakes).

**Natural Climate Change:**

* Earth's climate has varied naturally due to changes in earth's orbit and tilt.
* Sea levels have fluctuated as glacial ice melts and forms.

**Environmental Change and Habitat Disruption:**

* Major disturbances (e.g., rising sea levels) lead to habitat changes or loss.
* Wildlife may migrate to new habitats due to disruptions (e.g., wildebeests following rain patterns).
