**Ecological Tolerance**

**Ecological Range of Tolerance:**
- Species have a range of conditions they can tolerate before injury or death (e.g., temperature, salinity, pH).
- Genetic biodiversity allows individuals within a species to have different ranges of tolerance.

**Zones of Tolerance:**
- Optimal range: Optimal conditions for survival, growth, and reproduction.
- Zone of physiological stress: Survival but with stress (e.g., infertility, decreased activity).
- Zone of intolerance: Lethal conditions.

**FRQ Writing Tips:**
- Connect disturbances to ecological range of tolerance.
- Link human activities to climate change (e.g., CO2 release).
- Specify physiological stress caused by shifts in range of tolerance (e.g., suffocation, thermal shock).
