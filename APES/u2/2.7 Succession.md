**Succession**

**Types:**
- **Primary:** Starts on bare rock, with moss and lichen breaking down rock to form soil.
- **Secondary:** Begins on established soil after a disturbance (e.g., fire).

**Stages:**
- **Pioneer species:** Fast-growing, shade-tolerant, grow on shallow soil (e.g., moss, wildflowers).
- **Mid-successional species:** Larger, faster-growing, need deeper soil (e.g., shrubs, aspen).
- **Late-successional species:** Large, slow-growing, shade-tolerant, require deep soil (e.g., maples, oaks).

**Primary Succession:**
- Occurs on bare rock.
- Moss and lichen break down rock to form soil.

**Secondary Succession:**
- Occurs on established soil after a disturbance.
- Soil is already present and may be enriched with nutrients from fire.
