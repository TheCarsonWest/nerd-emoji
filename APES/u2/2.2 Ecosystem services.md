**Ecosystem Services**

**Definition:** Goods and services provided by natural ecosystems that benefit humans.

**Types:**

* **Provisioning:** Goods taken directly from ecosystems (e.g., food, timber)
* **Regulating:** Processes that moderate natural conditions (e.g., climate regulation, air purification)
* **Supporting:** Processes that support human activities (e.g., pollination, water filtration)
* **Cultural:** Recreation and scientific knowledge

**Human Disruption of Ecosystem Services:**

Human activities can degrade ecosystem services, with both ecological and economic consequences.

**Example:**

**Regulating Service:** Forests sequester carbon dioxide (CO2), reducing climate change and its impacts (e.g., sea level rise, crop failure).

**Degrading Activity:** Deforestation removes trees that store CO2, increasing atmospheric CO2 and the severity of climate change impacts. This leads to increased storm damage and crop failure, decreasing the value of the forest's regulating service.
