**Island Biogeography**

* **Theory:** Larger and closer-to-mainland islands support more species diversity due to:
    * Greater ecosystem diversity and food/habitat resources
    * More niches for species to occupy
    * Larger population sizes and genetic diversity
    * Lower extinction rates

* **Evolution on Islands:**
    * Limited space and resources create unique evolutionary pressures
    * Adaptive radiation: Single species evolve into multiple species to utilize different resources and reduce competition (e.g., Galapagos finches)
