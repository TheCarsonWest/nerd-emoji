**Adaptations**

* Genetic diversity exists due to mutations and crossing over.
* Adaptation: a trait that increases survival and reproduction.
* Natural selection: organisms with favorable adaptations survive and pass them on.
* Selective pressure: environmental factor that kills organisms without adaptations.
* Environmental Change and Evolution: changing environments lead to new adaptations.
* Pace of Evolution: species may not adapt quickly enough to rapid environmental changes.
* Genetic diversity and longer lifespans enhance adaptation capacity.

**Beak Size Data:**

* Finches on Island 1 have smaller beaks than those on Island 2.
* **Claim:** The difference in beak size is an adaptation to different food sources on the islands.
