*Threats to Biodiversity**

**Human Activities:**

* **Deforestation (logging, cities, roads)**
* **Wetland draining (agriculture, urbanization)**
* **Dam construction (reduces river water levels)**
* **Habitat fragmentation/loss (agriculture, urbanization)**
* **Invasive species (e.g., zebra mussels, kudzu vine)**
* **Human population growth (drives habitat loss)**
* **Pollution (oil spills, pesticides)**
* **Climate change (shifts biomes, alters temperature and precipitation)**
* **Overexploitation (excessive hunting or poaching)**
* **Roads and pipelines (fragmentation)**
* **Agriculture and urban land use**
* **Logging**

**Habitat Fragmentation:**

* Breaks larger habitats into smaller, isolated patches.
* Disrupts breeding, hunting, and migration.
* Reduces genetic diversity and resilience.

**Metapopulations:**

* Isolated subpopulations connected by habitat corridors.
* Allow gene flow and improve genetic diversity.

**Edge Effect:**

* Unique characteristics where two ecosystems meet.
* Can support diverse species, but also disruptive species.

**Climate Change:**

* Shifts biomes and species ranges.
* Changes precipitation patterns, leading to drought or flooding.
* Rises sea levels, flooding coastal ecosystems.

**Domestication and Agriculture:**

* Reduces genetic diversity in crops and livestock.
* Can lead to extinction of local breeds.

**Mitigating Biodiversity Loss:**

* **Protecting and connecting habitats (national parks, wildlife corridors)**
* **Sustainable land use (urban growth boundaries, reforestation)**
* **Restoring lost habitats (replanting forests, reestablishing prairies)**
