**Ozone Depletion**

**Protection from UV Radiation:**
- Stratospheric ozone absorbs harmful UV radiation from the sun.

**CFC Ozone Depletion:**
- Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) release chlorine atoms in the stratosphere.
- Chlorine atoms react with ozone, breaking it down into oxygen molecules.

**Montreal Protocol:**
- Global agreement to phase out CFC production.
- Replaced CFCs with HCFCs (less ozone-depleting) and HFCs (non-ozone-depleting but still GHGs).
- HFCs being replaced by HFOs (shorter atmospheric lifetime and lower global warming potential).
