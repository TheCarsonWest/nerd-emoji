**9.1 Stratospheric Ozone Depletion**

**Ozone and Life on Earth:**
* Stratospheric ozone absorbs harmful UV-B and UV-C radiation, protecting life from DNA damage and skin cancer.
* Ozone layer formation allowed life to evolve out of water onto land.

**Ozone Absorption of UV-B and UV-C:**
* UV-C breaks down O2 into free oxygen atoms that combine to form ozone (O3).
* UV-B and UV-C also break down ozone, releasing free oxygen atoms that can form more ozone.

**Anthropogenic Ozone Depletion:**
* Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in refrigeration and aerosols release free chlorine atoms that break down ozone.
* A single chlorine atom can destroy up to 100,000 ozone molecules over its lifetime.

**Natural Ozone Depletion:**
* Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) in Antarctica form in extreme cold and release chlorine atoms that break down ozone.
