**Invasive Species**

**Characteristics:**

* Non-native to an area, introduced by humans
* R-selected and generalist species
* High biotic potential, low parental care
* Adaptable, competitive, thrive in non-native habitats

**Examples:**

* Zebra Mussel: Aggressive filter feeders, clog pipes
* Kudzu Vine: Rapid growth, outcompetes natives
* Asian Carp: Outcompetes native fish for food and space
* Emerald Ash Borer: Kills trees by disrupting nutrient transport
* Cane Toad: Decimates mammal populations
* Pythons: Aggressive hunters with no natural predators

**Impacts:**

* Estimated to cost US $120 billion/year
* Reduced agricultural productivity, tourism, property value, fishery decline

**Control Methods:**

* Laws preventing transport of invasives
* Removal and control programs
