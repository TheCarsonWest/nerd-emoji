**Global Climate Change**

**Historic Climate Change:**
* Earth's climate has varied over time due to variations in its orbit around the sun (Milankovitch Cycles).
* Global ice ages and warmer periods occur roughly every 100,000 years.
* CO2 levels are strongly correlated with temperature, but causality is not fully understood.

**Effects of Climate Change:**
* Rising temperature: Habitat/species loss, drought, heat waves, increased precipitation.
* Rising sea level: Glacial melt, thermal expansion.
* Melting of permafrost: Release of methane and CO2.

**Risks of Global Warming to 2.0Â°C:**
* Impact on coastal communities: Property loss, relocation.
* Impact on atmospheric currents: Widening and weakening of Hadley cell, destabilizing jet stream.
* Impact on marine ecosystems: Altered ranges, reduced oxygen levels.
* Impact on ocean circulation: Suppression of thermohaline circulation.

**Unequal Global Warming:**
* Polar regions warm faster (polar amplification).
* Melting sea ice creates a positive feedback loop.
* Air pollution contributes to warming in polar regions.

**Impact on Polar Ecosystems:**
* Arctic sea ice loss: Habitat loss for seals, polar bears, and other organisms.
