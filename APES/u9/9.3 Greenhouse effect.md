**Greenhouse Effect**

**Solar Radiation:**
* Not all solar radiation reaches Earth's surface, with some reflected and absorbed by clouds and the atmosphere.

**Greenhouse Effect:**
* Gases in the atmosphere, including water vapor and CO2, trap heat from the sun and radiate it back to Earth.
* Without this effect, Earth would be too cold for life.

**Greenhouse Gases and Sources:**
* CO2: Fossil fuel combustion, decomposition, deforestation
* Methane: Natural gas extraction, animal agriculture, anaerobic decomposition
* Nitrous oxide: Agricultural soils (overwatering, overfertilization)
* CFCs/HCFCs/HFCs: Refrigerants, aerosol products

**Global Warming Potential (GWP):**
* Measures the warming potential of a greenhouse gas relative to CO2.
* Factors include residence time and infrared absorption.

**Greenhouse Gases with GWP > 1:**
* Methane (CH4): Remains in the atmosphere for 12 years, absorbs more IR than CO2.
* Nitrous oxide (N2O): Remains in the atmosphere for 115 years, absorbs much more IR than CO2.
* CFCs: Remain in the atmosphere for decades to centuries, absorbing significantly more IR than CO2.
