**Ocean Acidification**

Increased CO2 in the atmosphere dissolves in the ocean, forming carbonic acid. This acid dissociates into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions, reducing the availability of carbonate ions.

**Impact on Marine Organisms:**

Marine organisms that build calcium carbonate shells, such as corals, mollusks, and urchins, rely on carbonate ions. As ocean acidification reduces carbonate availability, their shells become weaker and more susceptible to breakdown.

**Human Activities and Ocean Acidification:**

Anthropogenic activities like fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial emissions contribute to ocean acidification by increasing atmospheric CO2 and acid precipitation.

**Consequences for Marine Ecosystems:**

Ocean acidification threatens marine organisms, especially those that rely on calcium carbonate shells. It can disrupt their growth, reproduction, and survival, potentially leading to population declines and ecosystem imbalances.
