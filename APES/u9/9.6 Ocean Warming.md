**9.6 Ocean Warming**

**Objective/EKs/Skill:**
- Explain how the atmosphere and ocean interact to distribute heat.
- Describe the effects of ocean warming on marine species and coral reef ecosystems.

**Effects on Marine Species:**
- Reduced oxygen levels due to warmer water, causing respiratory stress.
- Altered migratory routes and mating seasons, especially for whales.
- Disrupted reproductive timing, particularly for fish.
- Habitat loss for corals due to ocean warming and acidification, leading to coral bleaching and algae blooms.

**Climate Change & Coral Reef:**
- **Coral Bleaching:** Corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae that provide them with food. When ocean temperatures rise, the algae leave the coral, causing bleaching and making them vulnerable to disease.
- **Other Threats:** Runoff pollutants, such as sediment and pesticides, can also harm coral reefs and force algae to leave.
