**Increase in Greenhouse Gases**

**Thermal Expansion**
* Warmer water molecules move apart, leading to sea level rise.

**Melting Ice Sheets and Glacial Ice**
* Increased greenhouse gases warm the climate, melting ice sheets and glaciers.
* This water flows into the ocean, further raising sea level.

**Environmental Impacts of Sea Level Rise**
* Flooding of coastal ecosystems (e.g., mangroves)
* Loss of species dependent on arctic and tundra habitats
* Deprivation of water source due to loss of glacial thaw-freeze cycle

**Human Impacts**
* Relocation of coastal populations
* Saltwater intrusion into groundwater
* Increased flood frequency and associated costs
* Displacement of refugees

**Disease Vectors**
* Warmer temperatures allow disease-carrying insects to expand their range towards the poles.
* This puts new human populations at risk of diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus.
