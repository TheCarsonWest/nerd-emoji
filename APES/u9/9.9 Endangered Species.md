**Endangered Species**

**Causes of Endangerment:**

* Poaching (hunting for fur, tusks, horns)
* Habitat loss and fragmentation
* Invasive species competition
* Climate change
* Overharvesting or hunting for food
* Removal from the wild for pets
* Niche specialization (limited food/habitat requirements)

**Preventing Endangerment:**

* Poaching prevention: armed guards, legislation
* Habitat protection: national parks, wildlife preserves
* Legislation: Endangered Species Act, CITES

**IUCN Red List:**

* Classifies species based on risk of extinction:
    * Abundant
    * Near Threatened
    * Vulnerable
    * Endangered
    * Critically Endangered

**Endangerment by Taxon:**

* Amphibians: 41% endangered, vulnerable to climate change
* Mammals: 25% endangered
* Birds: 13% endangered
* Warm Water Coral: 33% endangered
* Conifers: 34% endangered

**Specialists vs. Generalists:**

* Specialists more likely to become endangered due to limited habitat and food requirements
* Generalists more adaptable to changing conditions

**Competition and Endangerment:**

* Interspecific competition can threaten species, especially those already vulnerable to habitat disruption from climate change
