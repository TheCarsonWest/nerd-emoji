**Biomagnification**

* Accumulation of fat-soluble compounds (e.g., POPs, methylmercury) in organisms' tissues.

* Occurs due to compounds not easily dissolving in water and remaining in body fat.

* Concentrations increase up the trophic pyramid or food chain.

* Primary consumers ingest compounds from producers, passed on to secondary consumers, and so on.

* Organisms need to consume more at higher trophic levels (10% rule), leading to higher compound levels.

* Top predators (e.g., salmon, whales) have highest compound levels.

* Examples:

    * DDT: Causes eggshell thinning in predatory birds.
    * Methylmercury: Neurotoxic, damages nervous system.

* Human exposure via consumption of predatory fish.
