**Eutrophication**

**Process:**
* Excess nutrients (N and P) cause algae blooms.
* Algae cover water surface, blocking sunlight and killing plants.
* Decomposing algae deplete oxygen (O2).
* Low O2 levels kill aquatic animals.

**Anthropogenic Sources:**
* Sewage treatment plants
* Animal waste from CAFOs
* Synthetic fertilizers

**Oligotrophic Waterways:**
* Low nutrient levels
* Stable algae populations
* High O2 levels

**Dissolved Oxygen and Dead Zones:**
* Hypoxia (low O2) creates dead zones where aquatic life cannot survive.
* Most fish require at least 3.0 ppm O2 to survive.
