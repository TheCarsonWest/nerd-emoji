**POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants)**

* Long-lasting, synthetic chemicals that accumulate in the environment and living organisms.
* Fat-soluble, persisting in animal fat tissue and potentially impacting reproductive systems.

**Examples and Sources:**
* Pesticides (DDT)
* Industrial chemicals (PCBs, PBDEs, BPA)
* Dioxins (fertilizer production, waste combustion)
* Phthalates (plastics)
* Perchlorates (rocket fuel)
* Medications (via sewage treatment)

**Transport and Impact:**
* Travel long distances through wind and water.
* Accumulate in food webs, resulting in:
    * Reproductive failure and cancer in humans
    * Endocrine disruption and spawning failure in aquatic organisms
