**Human Impacts on Ecosystems**

- **Range of Tolerance:** Organisms have limits for abiotic factors (pH, temperature, etc.) and pollutants.

- **Acid Rain:** Low pH reduces population size and survival due to aluminum toxicity and disrupted blood balance.

- **Coral Reef Ecosystems:**
    - Algae have narrow temperature tolerance and leave coral when temperatures rise.
    - Human impacts include greenhouse gas emissions, runoff, and overfishing.

- **Oil Spills:**
    - Hydrocarbons are toxic and can kill marine organisms.
    - Effects include reduced visibility, oil on feathers, and contamination of bottom-dwellers.
    - Clean-up involves containment, skimming, and dispersants.

- **ANWR Controvery:**
    - Oil companies advocate for oil exploration in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge.
    - Environmentalists oppose due to potential damage to the fragile ecosystem.
