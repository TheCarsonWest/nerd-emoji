**Thermal Pollution**

**Objective:** Understand the effects of thermal pollution on aquatic organisms.

**Solubility of Oxygen & Temperature:**
* Warm water holds less dissolved oxygen (DO) than cold water.

**Thermal Pollution:**
* Release of heat into water, negatively impacting aquatic organisms.
* Increased water temperature and respiration rate (thermal shock).
* Reduced DO, leading to suffocation.

**Sources of Thermal Pollution:**
* Power plants (cool water used to cool steam)
* Manufacturing plants (cool water used for machinery)
* Nuclear power plants (large amounts of cool water required)
* Urban stormwater runoff (heat from pavement)

**Cooling Towers:**
* Cool steam back into water and hold warmed water before release.
* Used in nuclear power plants to reduce thermal pollution.
