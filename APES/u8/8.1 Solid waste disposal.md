**Solid Waste Disposal**

**Types of Solid Waste:**
- MSW (Municipal Solid Waste): Trash from cities (households, businesses, schools)
- E-Waste: Old electronics (computers, TVs, phones)

**Sanitary Landfills:**
- Clay/plastic bottom liner to prevent leakage
- Leachate collection system to treat pollutants
- Methane recovery system to generate energy
- Clay cap to seal the landfill

**Landfill Impacts:**
- Low decomposition rates due to lack of oxygen, moisture, and organic material combination
- Groundwater contamination from leachate leakage
- Greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4)

**Waste Incineration and Ocean Dumping:**
- Incineration reduces landfill volume but releases air pollutants
- Ocean dumping is illegal but still occurs, especially plastic, leading to pollution and harm to wildlife
