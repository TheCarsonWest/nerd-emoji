**Irrigation**

**Methods:**

* **Furrow Irrigation:** Digging trenches to slowly seep water into the soil (66% efficient).
* **Flood Irrigation:** Flooding the entire field (80% efficient).
* **Spray Irrigation:** Using nozzles to spray water (more efficient but expensive).
* **Drip Irrigation:** Slow dripping of water directly to roots (over 95% efficient).

**Issues:**

* **Waterlogging:** Overwatering saturating the soil, depriving roots of oxygen.
* **Salinization:** Salt buildup in soil from evaporated irrigation water (can dehydrate roots).

**Solutions:**

* **Drip Irrigation:** Conserves water, prevents waterlogging.
* **Soil Aeration:** Poking holes to allow oxygen and water drainage.
* **Flushing with Fresh Water:** Diluting salt buildup.

**Global Human Water Use:**

* Industrial: Power plants, manufacturing.
* Municipal: Households (drinking, sanitation).
* Agricultural: Livestock, irrigation.

**Aquifers and Groundwater:**

* **Groundwater:** Water stored in underground rock and sediment.
* **Aquifers:** Usable groundwater deposits.
* **Recharge:** Rainwater replenishing aquifers.

**Aquifer Depletion:**

* **Cone of Depression:** Lowering water table from excessive pumping.
* **Saltwater Intrusion:** Saltwater seeping into groundwater from lowered water pressure.
