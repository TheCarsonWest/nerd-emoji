**Urbanization**

* Converts natural vegetation to impervious surfaces, reducing groundwater recharge and causing runoff.
* Contributes to CO2 emissions from cement production, construction, deforestation, and waste disposal.

**Urbanization in Coastal Cities**

* Excessive groundwater withdrawal can lead to saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise.

**Population Trends**

* Movement from rural to urban areas for jobs, entertainment, and cultural attractions.
* Urban areas have higher population density, reducing environmental impact per person.
* Suburban population is growing rapidly.

**Urban Sprawl**

* Movement from urban centers to less dense suburban areas.
* Causes: cheaper property, cars for transportation, domino effect.
* Effects: abandoned homes and businesses, decline in city services and tax revenue.

**Solutions**

* Urban growth boundaries to limit development.
* Public transport and walkable city design to encourage residents to stay in urban areas.
* Mixed land use to promote walkability and a sense of place.

**Possible Economic Consequence of Solution**

* Reduced property values in suburbs due to reduced demand for housing.
