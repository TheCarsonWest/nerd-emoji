**Tragedy of the Commons**

* Concept: Individuals overuse public resources in their self-interest, depleting them.

**Examples:**
* Overfishing
* Overgrazing
* Air and water pollution
* Groundwater depletion

**Causes:**
* No individual ownership
* Assumption that others will overuse
* Lack of penalties for overuse

**Consequences:**
* Fishery collapse
* Respiratory problems
* Contaminated water sources

**Solutions:**
* Private or government ownership
* Fees or taxes for use
* Laws and regulations with penalties for pollution
* Management agencies (e.g., BLM for rangelands)

**Additional Commons:**
* Oceans: Overfishing, pollution
* Solution: Marine protected areas, sustainable fishing practices
