**IPM (Integrated Pest Management)**

**Objective:** Minimize environmental disruption and pesticide use while controlling pests.

**Methods:**

* **Crop Rotation:** Disrupting pest life cycles by planting different crops each season.
* **Intercropping:** Planting multiple crops to provide habitat or attract pest predators.
* **Biocontrol:** Introducing natural predators (e.g., ladybugs, spiders) or parasites to control pests.

**Benefits:**

* Reduces pesticide exposure for consumers and non-target species.
* Reduces water contamination from pesticide runoff.

**Drawbacks:**

* Can be more time-consuming and costly than traditional pesticide use.
