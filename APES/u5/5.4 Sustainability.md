**Sustainability**

**Definition:** Using resources in a way that doesn't deplete or degrade them for future generations.

**Maximum Sustainable Yield:** The maximum amount of a renewable resource that can be harvested without reducing its availability for the future.

**Environmental Indicators of Sustainability:**

* **Biodiversity:** The variety of life on Earth. Higher biodiversity indicates healthier ecosystems.
* **Food Production:** The ability of the Earth's resources to support agriculture. Threats include climate change, soil degradation, and increasing meat consumption.
* **Atmospheric Temperature & CO2:** Life depends on a narrow temperature range. Increased CO2 from deforestation and fossil fuel combustion raises temperatures, making it unsustainable.
* **Human Population & Resource Depletion:** Increasing population leads to increased resource depletion, harming ecosystems.
