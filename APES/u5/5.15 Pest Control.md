**5.15 Pest Control**

**Pest Control Methods:**

* **Pesticides:** Chemicals that kill pests
    * Rodenticides: Rodents
    * Fungicides: Fungi
    * Insecticides: Insects
    * Herbicides: Plants

**Overuse Concerns:**

* Pests can become resistant to pesticides.
* **Pesticide Treadmill:** Repeated pesticide use selects for resistant pests, leading to increased pesticide use.

**GMOs (Genetic Modification):**

* Genes for pest resistance added to plants.
* Bt corn: Bacteria gene produces Bt crystals toxic to pests.
* Roundup Ready crops: Resistant to glyphosate herbicide.

**GMOs & Pesticide Use:**

* Bt corn reduces insecticide use.
* Roundup Ready crops increase herbicide use.

**GMOs & Genetic Diversity:**

* GM crops lack genetic diversity, making them vulnerable to pests and diseases.
