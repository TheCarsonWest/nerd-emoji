**Aquaculture**

**Benefits:**
- Requires minimal resources (water, space, fuel)
- Reduces fishery collapse risk
- Land-free compared to terrestrial livestock

**Drawbacks:**
- High-density farming:
    - Waste accumulation (eutrophication, E. coli)
    - Increased disease risk, potentially infecting wild populations
- Introduction of non-native species or GMOs through escapees
- Antibiotic use in fish feed, leading to water contamination
