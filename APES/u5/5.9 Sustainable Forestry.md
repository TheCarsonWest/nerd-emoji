**Sustainable Forestry**

* **Clearcutting**
    * Efficient but harmful: soil erosion, stream and soil temp increase, flooding
    * Trees provide ecosystem services:
        * Air pollution filtration
        * Carbon sequestration
        * Habitat and biodiversity support

* **Ecologically Sustainable Forestry**
    * Minimizes ecosystem damage
    * Selective cutting preserves habitat and topsoil
    * Replanting maintains productivity and future forests

**Stopping Natural Fires**

* Leads to more biomass buildup
* Monitoring instead of suppression can prevent worse fires

**Prescribed Burns**

* Burn dead biomass, preventing larger fires
* Recycle nutrients for new growth
