**Green Revolution**

**What it is:** Shift to large-scale, industrial agriculture using:

* **Mechanization:** Tractors, combines
* **High-Yield Variety (HYV) Crops:** Genetically modified for higher yield
* **GMOs:** Crops with new genes for drought tolerance, pest resistance, etc.
* **Synthetic Fertilizer:** Man-made nutrients for plant growth
* **Irrigation:** Watering fields from external sources
* **Pesticides:** Chemicals to kill pests

**Pros:**

* Increased food supply
* Decreased world hunger
* Increased land efficiency

**Cons:**

* **Mechanization:** Fossil fuel reliance, soil compaction
* **HYV Crops/GMOs:** Decreased genetic diversity, increased pest/disease susceptibility
* **Fertilization:** Eutrophication, fossil fuel use
* **Irrigation:** Groundwater depletion, soil salinization
* **Pesticides:** Non-target species harm, water contamination
