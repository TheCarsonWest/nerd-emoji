**5.11 Clearcutting**

**Objectives:** Describe the effects of clearcutting on forests.

**Essential Knowledge:**

* Clearcutting is economically advantageous but has negative environmental consequences.
* Clearcutting leads to soil erosion, increased stream and soil temperatures, and flooding.
* Forests absorb pollutants and store carbon dioxide, reducing climate change.

**Effects of Clearcutting:**

**Direct Effects:**

* Soil erosion due to loss of stabilizing root structure
* Increased stream and soil temperature due to loss of tree shade
* Flooding and landslides due to decreased water retention

**Indirect Effects:**

* Tree plantations lower biodiversity and resilience
* Reduced air filtering and carbon storage services
* Deforestation releases greenhouse gases
