**Urban Runoff**

**Consequences:**
* Reduced infiltration (groundwater recharge)
* Pollutants (salt, sediment, fertilizer, pesticides, oil/gasoline) washed into surface waters

**Solutions:**

* **Permeable Pavement:**
    * Allows stormwater to infiltrate and recharge groundwater
    * Decreases runoff and pollutants
    * More costly than traditional pavement

* **Rain Garden:**
    * Plants surrounding storm drains soak up runoff
    * Decreases runoff and likelihood of flooding
    * Creates wildlife habitat, stores CO2

* **Public Transit:**
    * Reduces cars on road, decreasing pollutants and runoff
    * Decreases CO2 emissions and traffic

* **Building Up, Not Out:**
    * Decreases impervious surfaces (roofs, parking lots)
    * Can combine with "green roofs" or rooftop gardens to further reduce runoff and sequester CO2
