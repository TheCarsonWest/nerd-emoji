**Overfishing**

**Impacts:**
- Population decline, potential collapse
- Decreased biodiversity
- Economic losses

**Causes:**
- Tragedy of the Commons: No incentive to prevent overfishing
- Bottom trawling: Damages ocean floor, catches non-target species

**Consequences:**
- Fishing Down the Food Web: Depletion of large predators leads to overpopulation of smaller fish
- Trophic Cascade: Reduced food supply for marine mammals and seabirds
