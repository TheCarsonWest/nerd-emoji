**Agricultural Practices**

**Monocropping:**
- Growing a single crop
- Efficient but reduces biodiversity, increases pests, and accelerates soil erosion

**Tilling:**
- Breaks up soil for planting
- Increases erosion, loss of nutrients, and air and water pollution

**Slash & Burn:**
- Deforests land for agriculture
- Releases greenhouse gases, air pollutants, and lowers albedo

**Synthetic Fertilizers:**
- Do not add organic matter to soil
- Leach into groundwater and surface waters, causing contamination and eutrophication
