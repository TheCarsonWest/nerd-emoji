**Mining**

**Objectives:**

* Describe mining basics
* Discuss surface mining and subsurface mining
* Explain environmental impacts of mining
* Explain mine reclamation

**Key Terms:**

* Ore: Valuable mineral deposits
* Metals: Conductive elements
* Reserve: Known amount of resource left
* Overburden: Soil and vegetation removed
* Tailings/Slag: Leftover waste material

**Surface Mining:**

* Removes overburden to access ore
* Types: open pit, strip, mountaintop removal, placer
* Impacts:
    * Erosion
    * Habitat loss
    * Increased stream turbidity
    * PM release
    * Mountaintop removal: severe landscape damage

**Subsurface Mining:**

* More expensive and dangerous
* Vertical shaft drilled into ground
* Risks: gas exposure, mine collapse, injury

**Environmental Impacts:**

* Acid mine drainage: Rainwater mixes with pyrite, forming sulfuric acid
* Methane release: Coal mining releases CH4, a GHG
* Topsoil erosion
* Habitat loss
* PM release

**Mine Reclamation:**

* Restores land after mining
* Involves contouring, filling shafts, replanting, removing topsoil contaminants

**Environmental Impact of High Sulfur Content:**

* Acid mine drainage: Sulfur in tailings/overburden combines with rainwater to form sulfuric acid
* **Solution:** Neutralize acid with lime or other alkaline materials before water runoff
