    * Travel
    * Meat consumption
    * Fossil fuel usage
* **Decrease Footprint:**

**Global Ecological Footprint**

* Current global footprint: 1.85 earths
* Each year, humanity consumes 1.85 times what the Earth can produce annually.

* Current average US ecological footprint: 5.1 earths
* If the entire world consumed resources like the average American, 5.1 earths would be needed.
