**Bad Agriculture**

**CAFOs (Feedlots)**

* Densely crowded animal facilities for rapid growth.
* Antibiotics and growth hormones used to prevent disease and speed production.
* Maximizes land use and profit, minimizes consumer costs.
* Produces large amounts of waste, greenhouse gases, and water contamination.

**Manure Lagoons**

* Open pits for animal waste storage.
* Contain harmful substances like ammonia, bacteria, and antibiotics.
* Can contaminate water sources and release greenhouse gases.

**Free Range Grazing**

* Natural grazing without hormones or antibiotics.
* Disperses waste naturally, acting as fertilizer.
* Requires more land and is more expensive.

**Overgrazing**

* Excessive grazing leads to topsoil erosion and desertification.
* Rotational grazing can prevent overgrazing.

**Inefficiency of Meat**

* Producing meat is less efficient than producing plants in terms of energy, land, and water use.
* Requires all the energy and resources used to grow crops for animal feed, plus additional energy for animal care and processing.
