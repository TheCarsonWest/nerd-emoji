- **Biome:** Community of organisms adapted to a specific environment, defined by climate (temperature and precipitation).

- **Latitude:** Distance from the equator determines temperature and precipitation, influencing biome distribution.

- **Nutrient Availability:**
    - Tropical rainforests: Nutrient-poor soil due to intense competition and rapid decomposition.
    - Boreal forests: Nutrient-poor soil due to low temperatures and slow decomposition.
    - Temperate forests: Nutrient-rich soil due to abundant dead organic matter and warm temperatures.

- **Shifting Biomes:**
    - Climate change can shift biomes, e.g., warming temperatures will expand boreal forests northward as tundra melts and lower latitudes become too warm for current vegetation.
