**Aquatic Biomes**

**Characteristics:**

* **Depth:** Affects sunlight penetration and photosynthesis.
* **Temperature:** Warmer water holds less oxygen, limiting organisms.
* **Salinity:** Determines the species that can survive.
* **Flow:** Influences oxygenation and habitat suitability.

**Freshwater Biomes:**

* **Rivers:** High oxygen due to flow, carry nutrient-rich sediments.
* **Lakes:** Littoral, limnetic, profundal, and benthic zones.

**Freshwater Wetlands:**

* Areas with submerged or saturated soil.
* Plants adapted to waterlogged conditions.
* Benefits include flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollution filtering.

**Estuaries:**

* Mix of fresh and salt water.
* High productivity due to nutrient-rich sediments.
* Habitat for fish, shellfish, and mangrove trees.

**Coral Reefs:**

* Warm, shallow waters with diverse marine life.
* Mutualistic relationship between coral and algae: coral provides CO2 and shelter, algae provides energy.

**Intertidal Zones:**

* Coastline between high and low tide.
* Organisms adapted to withstand waves, sunlight, and desiccation.

**Open Ocean:**

* Low productivity except for algae and phytoplankton.
* Photic and aphotic zones based on sunlight penetration.
