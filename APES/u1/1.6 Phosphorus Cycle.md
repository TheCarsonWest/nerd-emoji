**Phosphorus Cycle**

**Key Points:**

* Slow cycle compared to other biogeochemical cycles.
* Major reservoirs: rocks and sediments containing phosphorus minerals.
* Weathering of rocks releases phosphate into soil and water.
* No gas phase; phosphorus does not enter the atmosphere.
* Phosphorus is a limiting nutrient, often limiting plant growth in ecosystems.
* Organisms assimilate phosphorus from plants or animals.
* Decomposers return phosphorus to soil.
* Sedimentation and geological uplift recycle phosphorus.

**Human Impacts:**

* Synthetic fertilizers and detergents/cleaners add excessive phosphorus to ecosystems.
* Eutrophication (excess nutrients) occurs in aquatic environments, leading to algae blooms, oxygen depletion, and fish kills.
