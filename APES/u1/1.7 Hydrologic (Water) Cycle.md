**Water Cycle**

* Continuous cycle of water movement between different sources and sinks.
* Driven by solar energy, transforming water among solid, liquid, and gas states.

**Evaporation and Evapotranspiration**

* Processes that convert liquid water to water vapor, entering the atmosphere.
* Transpiration: Plants draw groundwater to leaves, releasing it as vapor through stomata.

**Runoff and Infiltration**

* Precipitation can either flow over the surface (runoff) or soak into the ground (infiltration).
* Infiltration recharges groundwater aquifers, while runoff replenishes surface waters.
