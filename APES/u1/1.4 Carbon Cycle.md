**Carbon Cycle**

**Overview:**
- Movement of carbon between sources (release CO2) and sinks (absorb CO2).
- Imbalances can lead to increased atmospheric CO2 and global warming.

**Key Reservoirs:**
- Atmosphere: Key carbon reservoir, increased CO2 contributes to global warming.
- Sinks: Absorb more carbon than they release (ocean, plants, soil).
- Sources: Release more carbon than they absorb (fossil fuel combustion, deforestation).

**Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration:**
- Photosynthesis: Removes CO2 from atmosphere, converts to glucose (energy).
- Cellular Respiration: Releases CO2 into atmosphere, releases energy.

**Ocean and Atmosphere:**
- Direct exchange of CO2 between ocean surface and atmosphere.
- Increased atmospheric CO2 leads to ocean acidification.

**Ocean Carbon Storage:**
- Algae and phytoplankton remove CO2 through photosynthesis.
- Coral reefs and organisms with shells use CO2 to create calcium carbonate exoskeletons.
- Sedimentation and burial store CO2 in ocean floor over time.

**Burial, Extraction, and Combustion:**
- Burial: Slow geological process that stores carbon in sedimentary rock or fossil fuels.
- Extraction and combustion of fossil fuels releases CO2 into atmosphere, increasing its concentration.
