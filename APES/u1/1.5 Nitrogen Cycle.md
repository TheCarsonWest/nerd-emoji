**Nitrogen Cycle**

**Overview:**
* Nitrogen is essential for plants and animals and is primarily found in the atmosphere as N2 gas.
* Nitrogen cycles between the atmosphere and living organisms through various processes.

**Sources:**
* Nitrogen fixation: Converts N2 gas into usable forms (NH3, NO3-) by synthetic processes (e.g., fertilizer production) and bacteria.

**Other Steps:**
* Nitrification: Converts NH3 into NO2- and NO3-.
* Ammonification: Decomposers convert waste and dead biomass into NH3.
* Assimilation: Plants and animals incorporate nitrogen into their bodies.
* Denitrification: Converts soil NO3- into N2O gas, returning it to the atmosphere.

**Human Impacts:**
* Fertilizer use can lead to nitrate leaching and ammonia volatilization, polluting water and the atmosphere.
* Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas released through denitrification.
* Ammonia gas from fertilizers can cause respiratory irritation.
