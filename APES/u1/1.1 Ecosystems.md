**Ecosystems**

* **Ecosystem:** All living and nonliving things in an area (plants, animals, rocks, soil, water, air)
* **Individual:** One organism (e.g., elk)
* **Population:** Group of individuals of the same species (e.g., elk herd)
* **Biome:** Plants and animals found in a given region (determined by climate)

**Organism Interactions**

* **Mutualism:** Relationship that benefits both organisms (e.g., coral reef)
* **Commensalism:** Relationship that benefits one organism and doesn't impact the other (e.g., birds nesting in trees)
* **Competition:** Organisms fighting over resources (food, shelter); limits population size
* **Predation:** One organism using another for energy (hunters, parasites, even herbivores)

**Predation**

* **Herbivores:** Plant eaters (e.g., giraffe)
* **True predators (carnivores):** Kill and eat prey (e.g., leopard)
* **Parasites:** Use a host organism for energy, often living inside host (e.g., mosquitoes, tapeworms)
* **Parasitoids:** Lay eggs inside a host organism; larvae eat host

**Symbiosis**

* Close and long-term interaction between two organisms of different species
* **Mutualism:** Organisms of different species living together in a way that benefits both (e.g., coral and algae)
* **Commensalism:** One organism benefits, the other is unaffected (e.g., birds nesting in trees)
* **Parasitism:** One organism benefits, the other is harmed (e.g., mosquitoes and humans)

**Competition**

* Reduces population size due to limited resources
* **Resource partitioning:** Using the same resource in different ways (e.g., different root lengths)
* **Temporal partitioning:** Using the resource at different times (e.g., wolves and coyotes hunting at different times)
* **Spatial partitioning:** Using different areas of a shared habitat (e.g., birds living in different parts of a tree)
* **Morphological partitioning:** Using different body features to access different resources
