* Released by combustion
* Contributes to ozone formation and acid precipitation

**Lead:**
* Neurotoxicant
* Phased out of gasoline

**Primary vs. Secondary Air Pollutants:**
* **Primary:** Emitted directly (NOx, CO, SO2, PM)
* **Secondary:** Formed from primary pollutants in presence of sunlight (O3, sulfuric acid)
