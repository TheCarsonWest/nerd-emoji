Write a shortish, clear, and concise summarization as notes

**Photochemical Smog**

**Precursors:**

* Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
* Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
* Sunlight

**Conditions:**

* Warmth
* Sunlight

**Formation:**

* Sunlight breaks down NO2 into NO + O.
* Free O atom combines with O2 to form O3 (ozone).
* O3 combines with photochemical oxidants (NO + VOCs) to form photochemical smog.

**Impacts:**

* Reduces sunlight, limiting photosynthesis.
* Damages plant stomata and irritates animal respiratory tracts.
* Respiratory irritant, worsening asthma, bronchitis, and COPD.

**Factors Increasing Smog Formation:**

* Higher VOCs emissions
* Increased vehicle traffic
* More sunlight
* Warmer temperatures

**Reduction Measures:**

* Decrease vehicle emissions through:
    * Carpooling, public transport, biking, walking
    * Fewer vehicles on the road = less gas = fewer VOCs
* Increase electricity production from renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro)
* Use natural gas power plants over coal
