Write a shortish, clear, and concise summarization as notes

Indoor air pollution is a significant health risk, especially in developing countries where people cook with biomass fuels like wood and dung which release harmful pollutants. Developed countries have better ventilation and use cleaner burning fuels but still face risks from chemicals in products and building materials like asbestos and lead paint.

Here are some key pollutants to watch out for:

- **Particulate Matter (PM)** including smoke, dust and asbestos fibers can irritate lungs and cause serious health problems.
- **Carbon Monoxide (CO)** is an odorless and colorless gas that can cause suffocation. Install CO detectors in your home.
- **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)** are chemicals in many household products that can irritate eyes and lungs.
- **Radon** is a radioactive gas that can cause lung cancer. Test your home for radon and seal cracks in the foundation to prevent it from entering.
- **Dust and Mold** can worsen respiratory problems. Control dust by cleaning regularly and fix moisture problems to prevent mold growth.
- **Lead** from old paint can be especially harmful to children.
