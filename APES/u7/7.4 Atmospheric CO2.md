**Atmospheric CO2 and PM**

**Natural Sources of CO2:**

* Respiration of all living organisms
* Combustion of biomass (e.g., forest fires)
* Volcanoes

**Natural Sources of PM:**

* Decomposition of organic matter (aerobic and anaerobic)
* Sea salt, pollen, ash, dust
* Plants (especially conifers)

**Particulate Matter (PM)**

* **PM10:** <10 micrometers, from combustion and dust
* **PM2.5:** <2.5 micrometers, from combustion and smaller dust particles, more harmful to lungs
