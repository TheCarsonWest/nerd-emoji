Write a shortish, clear, and concise summarization as notes

**Acid Rain**

**Sources:**
* NOx: Vehicles, diesel generators, coal power plants
* SO2: Coal power plants, metal factories, diesel vehicles

**Formation:**
* NOx and SO2 react with oxygen and water in the atmosphere to form nitric and sulfuric acid.
* These acids dissociate into hydrogen ions (H+) in water.

**Environmental Effects:**
* Soil and water acidification: H+ displaces nutrients and makes toxic metals more soluble.
* Damage to plants and animals: Aluminum toxicity, disrupted blood osmolarity.

**Mitigation:**
* Reduce NOx and SO2 emissions: Higher fuel efficiency standards, public transit, renewable energy.
* Neutralize acidic soil/water: Limestone (calcium carbonate) reacts with H+ to neutralize acidity.
