Pictured above is the ideal racing line around for the Fairmont Hairpin at the Monaco Street Circuit. The line that the McLaren car takes around the hairpin, noted by the red line, is modeled by function:
## $$y = .092x^2-2.41x+15, \{0\leq x\leq 27\}$$
Where $y$ and $x$ are relative coordinates measured in meters

---

### (a) Find the total distance covered by the car throughout the course of the hairpin
### (b) The speed at time $t$ seconds of the McLaren through the Fairmont hairpin is modelled by $$s(t) = 6.11t^{2}-16.67t+23.32$$
#### Where $s(t)$ is in meters per second. Assume that $t=0$ is at the same point where $x=0$ along the line which the car takes. Find the amount of time the McLaren takes to travel through the Fairmont Hairpin. Round to the nearest thousandth of a second

# Solutions

# (a):
We need to find the Arc Length of the line that the car takes
For simplicity we will do solve using $y=f(x)$
#### $$\int_{0}^{27}\sqrt{ 1+(f'(x))^2 }dx = 45.09697 \text{ Meters}$$
# (b):
We simply need to find how long it takes the car to travel $45.09697$ Meters
## $$\int_{0}^{x}s(t)dt=45.09697$$
**Solve using desmos**

### $$\int_{0}^{2.818}s(t)dt=\boxed{45.09697}$$
#### $$\boxed{ \text{It takes 2.818 Seconds for the McLaren to go through the Fairmont Hairpin}}$$
