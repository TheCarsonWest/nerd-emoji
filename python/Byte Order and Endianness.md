# [[Handling Binary Files]]
# [[Byte Order and Endianness]] 
This note covers byte order and endianness in Python.

Python, being a high-level language, mostly abstracts away the details of byte order.  However, understanding endianness is crucial when working with binary data, network programming, or interacting with lower-level systems.

**What is Endianness?**

Endianness refers to the order in which bytes of a multi-byte data type (like integers, floats) are stored in computer memory.  There are two main types:

* **Big-Endian:** The most significant byte (MSB) is stored at the lowest memory address.  Think of it as writing numbers from left to right (most significant digit first).
* **Little-Endian:** The least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest memory address. Think of it as writing numbers from right to left (least significant digit first).

**Example:**

Let's consider the 32-bit integer `0x12345678` (hexadecimal representation).

* **Big-Endian:**  Memory addresses would look like this:
    ```
    Address:  0x1000  0x1001  0x1002  0x1003
    Byte:     0x12    0x34    0x56    0x78 
    ```

* **Little-Endian:** Memory addresses would look like this:
    ```
    Address:  0x1000  0x1001  0x1002  0x1003
    Byte:     0x78    0x56    0x34    0x12
    ```


**Python's `struct` Module:**

The `struct` module provides functions to pack and unpack data in different byte orders.  You can specify the byte order using format codes:

* `>`: Big-endian
* `<`: Little-endian
* `@`: Native byte order (system dependent)

```python
import struct

# Pack a 32-bit integer in big-endian order
big_endian_data = struct.pack(">I", 0x12345678) 
print(big_endian_data) # Output will vary depending on your system, but the order will be big-endian


# Pack a 32-bit integer in little-endian order
little_endian_data = struct.pack("<I", 0x12345678)
print(little_endian_data) # Output will vary depending on your system, but the order will be little-endian

# Unpack the data (remember to use the same byte order!)
unpacked_big = struct.unpack(">I", big_endian_data)[0]
unpacked_little = struct.unpack("<I", little_endian_data)[0]
print(hex(unpacked_big)) # Output: 0x12345678
print(hex(unpacked_little)) # Output: 0x12345678

```

**[[Python Struct Module]]**  ([[Byte Order in Network Programming]])


**Determining Your System's Endianness:**

```python
import sys
print(sys.byteorder) # Output: 'little' (on most modern systems)
```

**Important Considerations:**

*  When working with binary files or network protocols, you must know the expected endianness to correctly interpret the data.  Mismatched endianness can lead to incorrect results.
* Python's built-in integer types handle endianness internally, so you typically don't need to worry about it for general integer operations. The concern primarily arises when dealing with raw binary data.
