# [[Libraries like NumPy]]
# [[NumPy Fourier Transforms]] 
These notes cover the use of NumPy's functions for performing Fourier Transforms.  NumPy provides efficient implementations for these crucial signal processing operations.

Key functions:

* `numpy.fft.fft()`: Computes the one-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, [[1.0, -[[1.0]])
transformed_x = np.fft.fft(x)
print(transformed_x)
```

* `numpy.fft.ifft()`: Computes the inverse DFT, reconstructing the original signal from its Fourier transform.
```python
original_x = np.fft.ifft(transformed_x)
print(original_x)
```

* `numpy.fft.fft2()`, `numpy.fft.ifft2()`: Two-dimensional DFT and inverse DFT, useful for image processing.
```python
image = np.random.rand(64, 64)
transformed_image = np.fft.fft2(image)
```

* `numpy.fft.fftn()`, `numpy.fft.ifftn()`:  N-dimensional DFT and inverse DFT, generalizing to higher dimensions.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Normalization:**  The scaling of the output of `fft()` and `ifft()` might need adjustment depending on the application.  Refer to the NumPy documentation for details on normalization factors.

* **Frequency Interpretation:** The output of `fft()` represents the frequency components of the input signal.  Understanding how the frequency axis is mapped is crucial for interpretation. [[Frequency Axis Interpretation]]

* **Real and Imaginary Parts:** The output of `fft()` is generally complex, with real and imaginary parts.  These represent the magnitude and phase of each frequency component respectively. [[Complex Numbers in FFT]]

* **Efficiency:** NumPy's FFT implementation uses highly optimized algorithms (typically FFTW) which are significantly faster than naive implementations.

**Example: Simple signal analysis**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Generate a simple sine wave
t = np.linspace(0, [[1, 128, endpoint=False)
sig = np.sin(2*np.pi*10*t)
# Add some noise
sig += np.random.randn(128)*0.[[1
# Compute and plot the FFT
sig_fft = np.fft.fft(sig)
plt.plot(np.abs(sig_fft))
plt.show()
```
