# [[Libraries like NumPy]]
# [[Performance Optimization in Python]] 
**Goal:**  Understand and apply techniques to improve Python code performance.

**Key Areas:**

* **Profiling:**  Crucial first step. Identify bottlenecks before optimizing.  Tools like `cProfile` and `line_profiler` are invaluable.

```python
import cProfile
cProfile.run('my_slow_function()') 
```

* **Algorithmic Optimization:** Often the biggest performance gains come from choosing better algorithms.  [[Algorithm Complexity Analysis]]

* **Data Structures:**  Using the right data structure can drastically impact speed.  [[Dictionaries]] (`dict`) for fast lookups, sets for membership testing, etc.  [[Python Data Structures: Performance Tradeoffs]]

* **List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions:**  Often faster than explicit loops.

```python
# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1000)]

# Generator expression (memory efficient for large datasets)
squares_gen = (x**2 for x in range(1000)) 
```

* **Numpy:** For numerical computation, Numpy arrays are significantly faster than Python lists due to vectorization and optimized C implementation. [[NumPy for Performance]]

```python
import numpy as np
# Numpy array operations are much faster than equivalent Python list operations.
```

* **Cython/JIT Compilers (e.g., Numba):** For computationally intensive parts of your code, consider using Cython to write C extensions or Numba for just-in-time compilation to machine code. [[Cython and Numba]]

* **Multiprocessing/Multithreading:** For CPU-bound tasks, leverage multiple cores using the `multiprocessing` module.  Be mindful of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations for multithreading. [[Concurrency in Python]]

* **Memory Management:** Avoid unnecessary object creation and copying. Use techniques like `del` to explicitly delete large objects when no longer needed.  Understand memory profiling tools. [[Memory Profiling in Python]]

* **Code Style and Readability:** While not directly performance-related, clean, well-structured code is easier to optimize and debug. [[Pythonic Code Style]]


**Example: Inefficient vs. Efficient Code**

```python
# Inefficient (using loops)
def inefficient_sum(data):
    total = 0
    for x in data:
        total += x
    return total

# Efficient (using sum())
def efficient_sum(data):
    return sum(data)
```
