# [[Bitwise [[Operators]]
# [[Bit Manipulation in Networking]] 
This topic is vast and needs breaking down.

* **Core Concepts:**
    * [[Binary Numbers and their Representation]]
    * [[Bitwise [[Operators]] in Python]]  (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left/right shift)
    * [[Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates]] (Underlying principles)

* **Networking Applications:**
    * **IP Addresses:**  Manipulating IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) using bitwise operations.  Requires understanding of network masks and subnetting. [[IP Addressing and Subnetting]]
    * **MAC Addresses:** Bitwise operations might be used for comparing or manipulating MAC addresses.
    * **Network Protocols:** Understanding how bit manipulation is used in various network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP header fields). [[TCP/IP Header Analysis]]
    * **Error Detection and Correction:**  Techniques like parity checks and checksums rely heavily on bit manipulation. [[Error Detection and Correction Codes]]
    * **Encryption/Decryption:** Bitwise operations are foundational to many encryption algorithms. [[Cryptography Basics]]

* **Python Libraries:**
    * The `struct` module for packing and unpacking binary data.  [[Python [[Struct Module]]

* **Examples:**
    * Simple examples showing how to set, clear, or toggle individual bits in an integer.
    * Example of checking if an IP address belongs to a specific subnet.
    * Example of calculating a simple checksum.


This outline provides a structured approach to understanding bit manipulation within the context of networking in Python. Each bracketed item represents a topic requiring further elaboration in its own separate note.
