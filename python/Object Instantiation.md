# [[Constructors]]
# [[Object Instantiation]] 
Object instantiation is the process of creating an instance of a class.  An instance is a specific object created from a class's blueprint.  The class defines the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) of the object, while the instance is a concrete realization of that blueprint with its own specific data.


```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed): #Constructor/initializer
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

#Instantiation
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")  #creates an instance of the Dog class
another_dog = Dog("Lucy", "Labrador")     #creates another instance


print(my_dog.name)  # Accessing attributes of the instance. Output: Buddy
my_dog.bark()       # Calling a method of the instance. Output: Woof!

print(another_dog.breed) # Output: Labrador
```

[[Classes and Objects]]  This note should cover the fundamental concepts of classes and objects in Python, including their definitions and purposes.

[[Constructors (__init__) ]] This note would detail the `__init__` method, its role in object creation, and how to use it effectively.  It would include examples of different constructor implementations.

[[Methods]]  This note will explain methods in Python â€“ how to define them within classes, how they operate on object data (using `self`), and different types of methods (e.g., instance methods, class methods, static methods).

[[Attributes]] This note will focus on attributes, how to define and access them within and outside of class methods.  It will cover instance variables vs. class variables.

[[Instantiation vs. Declaration]]  (This note compares and contrasts the creation of an instance and simply declaring a class)
