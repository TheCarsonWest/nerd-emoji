## Machine Language
A language a machine can read
### Properties of a language
- Alphabet
	- Almost every computer language is in the latin alphabet
- Lexis
	- sets of words
	- Dictionary
- Syntax
	- The set of rules a language uses to make proper sentences
- Semantics
	- Rules determining if something makes sense
# Program files
- They are called source code, and are written in a source file
- The source code for this markdown file is what you are reading right now, and the source file is ./non programming things about python.md
# Compilation
- Your computer **hardware** reads in an extremely simple machine language(binary), as to be extremely fast, but thats not very readable by humans who dont have a PHD in mathematics
- As you get closer from the hardware, to the kernel, the operating system, and to computer programs, the machine languages get higher order, Ex: from binary to hexadecimal to assembly, to C, .
- Higher order computer languages are slower
- to solve this, some higher order computer languages **compile themselves** into a lower order computer language, so that they can be easily written by humans, and be fast like ones that aren't
	- Java
- Others don't do this, and instead are just interpreted by an interpreter 
	- Python
# Origin of Python
- Python is a communal project spearheaded by Guido van Rossum
- The name python is from the show Monty Python because its funny and programmers are massive nerds
- It is a high level, object oriented, easy to write, interpreted langauge
