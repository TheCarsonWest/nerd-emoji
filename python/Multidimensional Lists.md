# [[Lists]]
# [[Multidimensional Lists]] 
Multidimensional lists in Python are lists within lists, creating a structure that can represent matrices, tables, or other higher-dimensional data.  The number of dimensions is limited only by memory and practicality.

**Example:**

```python
# A 2D list (matrix)
matrix = [
    [[1, [[2], [[3]],
    [[4], [[5], [[6]],
    [[7], 8, 9]
]

# Accessing elements:
print(matrix[0][0])  # Output: [[1 (first row, first column)
print(matrix[[1][[2]])  # Output: [[6] (second row, third column)


# A 3D list (e.g., a cube of data)
cube = [
    [[1, [[2]], [[3], [[4],
    [[5], [[6]], [[7, 8],
    [[9, 10], [11, 12]
]

print(cube[[1][0][[1]) #Output: [[6]

```

**Common Use Cases:**

* Representing matrices for mathematical operations.
* Storing tabular data (like spreadsheets).
* Implementing game boards or other grid-based structures.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Memory Efficiency:**  Multidimensional lists can consume significant memory, especially with large dimensions. Consider using NumPy arrays for better performance and memory management with large datasets. [[NumPy Arrays]]
* **Nested Loops:** Accessing and manipulating elements often requires nested loops.  
* **[[List Comprehension]]:**  List comprehensions can be used to create and manipulate multidimensional lists concisely.  [[List Comprehensions]]


**Example using [[List Comprehension]] to create a 2D list:**

```python
rows = [[3]
cols = [[4]
matrix = [[i * cols + j for j in range(cols)] for i in range(rows)]
print(matrix)
```

**Example of accessing elements using nested loops:**

```python
for row in matrix:
    for element in row:
        print(element, end=" ")
    print()
```
