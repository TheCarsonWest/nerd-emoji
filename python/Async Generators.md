# [[Generators]]
# [[Async Generators]] 
Async generators are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to create asynchronous iterators.  They are similar to regular generators, but they use the `async` and `await` keywords to handle asynchronous operations. This allows you to yield values asynchronously without blocking the main thread.

Key differences from regular generators:

* **`async def`:** Async generators are defined using `async def` instead of `def`.
* **`await`:**  They can use `await` within the generator function to pause execution while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete.
* **`yield`:**  The `yield` keyword is used to produce values asynchronously.


**Example:**

```python
import asyncio

async def async_generator():
    for i in range([[3]]):
        await asyncio.sleep([[1]])  # Simulate an asynchronous operation
        yield i

async def main():
    async for value in async_generator():
        print(f"Received: {value}")

asyncio.run(main())

```

**Important Considerations:**

* **`async for`:**  You must use `async for` to iterate over an async generator.
* **[[Error Handling]]:**  Similar to regular generators, you need to handle potential exceptions within the async generator using `try...except` blocks.
* [[Asyncio]]  This is heavily reliant on the `asyncio` library.  Understanding `asyncio` is crucial for effectively using async generators.
* [[Coroutine Explained]]  Async generators are coroutines themselves.  Understanding coroutines is essential.


**Use Cases:**

* Streaming large datasets asynchronously.
* Handling asynchronous I/O operations efficiently (e.g., network requests).
* Building complex asynchronous pipelines.


**Further Exploration:**

* Research the `asynq` library for more advanced async programming techniques.
* Explore the use of async generators with libraries like `aiohttp` for network programming.

```python
# Example with error handling:

import asyncio

async def async_generator_with_error_handling():
    try:
        for i in range([[5]]):
            if i == [[3]]:
                raise ValueError("Something went wrong!")
            await asyncio.sleep(0.[[5]])
            yield i
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Caught an exception: {e}")
        yield -[[1]] # Yield a special value to signal an error


async def main_with_error_handling():
    async for value in async_generator_with_error_handling():
        print(f"Received: {value}")

asyncio.run(main_with_error_handling())
```
