# [[Regex Flags]]
# Regex Compilation

Regex compilation is the process of transforming a regular expression string into a compiled pattern object. This object can then be used for efficient matching against multiple strings.  This is generally faster than repeatedly compiling the same regex string.


```python
import re

# Uncompiled regex - slower for repeated use
pattern_string = r"\b\w{5}\b"  # Matches 5-letter words

# Compiled regex - faster for repeated use
compiled_pattern = re.compile(r"\b\w{5}\b") 

text = "This is a test string with some five letter words."

# Using uncompiled regex
match = re.search(pattern_string, text) #Slower
if match:
    print(f"Uncompiled Match: {match.group(0)}")

#Using compiled regex
match = compiled_pattern.search(text) #Faster
if match:
    print(f"Compiled Match: {match.group(0)}")

# Further usage with compiled pattern:
matches = compiled_pattern.findall(text)
print(f"All matches (compiled): {matches}")
```

**Benefits of Compilation:**

* **Performance:**  Significant speed improvement when the same regex is used multiple times. The compilation step is done only once.
* **Readability:** Compiled patterns can improve code readability, especially in complex regex scenarios.


**When to Compile:**

* Always compile if you are using the same regex multiple times on different strings.
* Consider compilation even for single use if the regex is complex and performance is critical.
