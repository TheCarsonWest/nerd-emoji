**Part 2: Salem Propaganda  
Using your knowledge of propaganda, create a poster that would be displayed in Salem to help deal with the current witch problem the town is facing. This could be propaganda to warn against joining the witches, to identify the witches, to reenforce the harm the witches could do to Salem, etc. This poster will be created on paper on turned in to your teacher. On the back of your poster you will briefly explain the SPACECAT of your work.**
make an outline for a poster that warns against joining witches

## Poster Outline: Warn Against Joining Witches (Salem Witch Trials Era)

**Visual Elements:**

* **Central Image:** A stylized depiction of a dark, shadowy figure (representing the devil or temptation) offering a poisoned apple (or similar tempting object) to a naive-looking Salem resident.  Consider a stark contrast between light and shadow to emphasize the good vs. evil dichotomy.
* **Border:**  A flame motif or thorny vine design could create a sense of danger and entrapment.
* **Color Palette:** Primarily dark and muted colors (greys, browns, deep reds) with perhaps a sickly green for the tempting object to create an unsettling atmosphere.

**Text Elements:**

* **Headline (Large & Bold):**  "Resist the Devil's Snare!" or "Shun the Path of Darkness!" - something short, impactful, and fear-inducing.
* **Subheading (Slightly smaller):** "Beware the Temptations of Witchcraft" or "Protect Your Soul from Eternal Damnation" - reinforces the headline's message.
* **Body Text (Smaller, concise points):**
    *  "Witchcraft leads to eternal damnation."
    *  "Do not consort with those who traffic with the Devil."
    *  "Confess any knowledge of witchcraft immediately to save your soul and our community."
    *  "The Devil promises power, but delivers only ruin."
    *  "True piety lies in God, not in dark magic."
* **Call to Action:** "Report Suspicious Activity! Save Salem!"


**SPACECAT Explanation (For the back of the poster):**

* **Speaker:** The Puritan church leaders/Salem authorities (implied).
* **Purpose:** To dissuade Salem residents from joining or associating with witches, fostering fear and encouraging reporting of suspected witchcraft.
* **Audience:** The general population of Salem, particularly those vulnerable to temptation or fear.
* **Context:** The Salem Witch Trials, a time of intense paranoia and religious fervor.
* **Exigence:** The perceived threat of witchcraft and its potential to destroy the community.
* **Choices:** The use of dark imagery, strong religious language, and fear-mongering tactics to achieve the desired effect.
* **Appeals:**
    * **Pathos:**  Plays on fear of damnation, social ostracization, and the Devil.
    * **Ethos:**  Leverages the authority of the church and community leaders (implied).
    * **Logos:**  Uses a simplistic logic that equates witchcraft with evil and damnation.
* **Tone:**  Urgent, cautionary, and threatening.


This outline provides a framework. You can adapt and modify it to fit your creative vision and the specific requirements of your assignment. Remember to consider the historical context and the intended impact on the Salem community when designing your poster.
