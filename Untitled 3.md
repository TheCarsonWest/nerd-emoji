if an acid and base of equal molarity react, but the base has a lower Kb value than the acids Ka value, will the solution be acidic or basic


The solution will be **acidic**.

Here's why:

*   **Ka and Kb:** Ka is the acid dissociation constant (strength of an acid). A higher Ka means a stronger acid. Kb is the base dissociation constant (strength of a base). A higher Kb means a stronger base.

*   **Equal Molarity:** Because the acid and base are present in equal molar amounts, they will react completely. The resulting solution's pH will depend on the relative strengths of the acid and base.

*   **Ka > Kb:** Since the Ka of the acid is greater than the Kb of the base, the acid is stronger than the base. This means the acid will donate more protons (H+) than the base will accept.

*   **Excess H+:** The excess protons (H+) in the solution will result in a pH less than 7, making the solution acidic.
