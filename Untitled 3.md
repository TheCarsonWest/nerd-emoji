Okay, here's a breakdown of the questions based on the provided link (http://edugreen.teri.res.in/explore/bio/green.htm) and the questions themselves, along with answers you can glean from the article:

**Important Note:** This link provides a basic overview of the Green Revolution. A comprehensive understanding may require additional research.

**Answers Based on the Provided Link:**

1.  **Where, when, and why did the Green Revolution begin? In other words, what were the main goals and reasons for the Green Revolution?**

    *   **Where:** The Green Revolution primarily began in **India**, but it also had a significant impact in other developing countries like Mexico and the Philippines.
    *   **When:** The Green Revolution started in the **mid-1960s**.
    *   **Why (Main Goals & Reasons):** The primary goal was to **increase food production** to combat widespread hunger and poverty, particularly in India.  The reasons included:
        *   **Population Growth:** Rapid population growth was putting immense pressure on food resources.
        *   **Food Scarcity:** Traditional agricultural practices were insufficient to meet the growing demand for food.
        *   **Poverty:** Food insecurity exacerbated poverty, leading to malnutrition and related health problems.

2.  **What was the strongest argument in favor of the Green Revolution?**

    *   The strongest argument was its **success in dramatically increasing food production**. It helped India and other countries become self-sufficient in food grains, avoiding widespread famine. The article highlights the significant rise in wheat and rice production as a direct result of the Green Revolution.

3.  **What were the methods used to increase food supply in India (there are 5)?**

    *   The article mentions these key methods:
        *   **Use of High-Yielding Varieties (HYVs):** Developing and introducing seeds of crops like wheat and rice that produced significantly higher yields than traditional varieties.
        *   **Increased Use of Fertilizers:**  Promoting the use of chemical fertilizers to provide essential nutrients to HYVs, maximizing their growth potential.
        *   **Improved Irrigation Facilities:** Investing in irrigation projects to ensure a reliable water supply for the crops, especially in regions with erratic rainfall.
        *   **Use of Pesticides and Herbicides:** Utilizing chemical pesticides and herbicides to protect crops from pests and weeds, minimizing crop losses.
        *   **Mechanization:** Introducing machinery like tractors and harvesters to improve efficiency and reduce labor requirements.

4.  **What economic policies were established to support the Green Revolution?**

    *   The article doesn't explicitly detail specific economic policies, but it does imply that government support was crucial.  Inferences we can make from the text are:
        *   **Subsidies:** Likely subsidies on fertilizers, seeds, and irrigation to encourage adoption by farmers.
        *   **Price Supports:** Guaranteed prices for agricultural produce to incentivize farmers to invest in the new technologies.
        *   **Investment in Infrastructure:** Government investment in irrigation projects, research and development of HYVs, and distribution networks for seeds and fertilizers.

5.  **How did the Green Revolution impact small, marginal farmers?**

    *   The article doesn't go into depth about the impact on small and marginal farmers.  However, based on common criticisms of the Green Revolution (which the article doesn't fully address), we can infer some impacts:
        *   **Increased Debt:** The need to purchase HYV seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation often led to increased debt for small farmers. If crops failed (due to weather or other factors), they could face severe financial hardship.
        *   **Dependence on External Inputs:** Small farmers became more dependent on external inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides) from corporations, potentially reducing their autonomy.
        *   **Displacement:** Some smaller farmers were unable to compete with larger farms that could more easily afford the new technologies, leading to displacement and land consolidation.

**Important Considerations & Things the Article Doesn't Cover:**

*   **Environmental Impacts:** The article doesn't adequately address the negative environmental consequences of the Green Revolution, such as:
    *   Soil degradation from overuse of chemical fertilizers.
    *   Water pollution from pesticide runoff.
    *   Depletion of groundwater resources due to excessive irrigation.
    *   Loss of biodiversity due to the focus on a few HYV crops.
*   **Social Inequality:** The article downplays the fact that the Green Revolution benefited larger landowners more than small farmers, exacerbating social inequality in some regions.
*   **Sustainability:**  The long-term sustainability of the Green Revolution model is questionable due to its reliance on non-renewable resources and its environmental impact.

To get a more complete picture of the Green Revolution, you should consult additional sources that discuss both its successes and its limitations.
