SUMMARIZING QUESTIONS 

1. Throughout these stations, you read many quotations from Native American people about their experiences during the ”Indian Wars” of the late 1800s. If you  were designing a museum exhibit to teach the “Indian Wars,” what quotation would you be sure to include in the exhibit? Why?  

  
  

2. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 6.9 million American Indian and Alaska Native people living in the United States in 2019, making up about 2.1% of  the total U.S. population. However, U.S. history courses often stop discussing the experiences of Native Americans after the Massacre of Wounded Knee. What  questions do you have about the long-term effects of the “Indian Wars” and U.S. policies toward Native Americans?**

| # **Summarizing Question 1**<br><br>I would include the quote from Black Elk about how a people’s dream died at Wounded Knee. It really shows how much the Massacre meant to the Native Americans, and how it wasn’t just a battle, but the end of their way of life.  It makes you think about the human cost of the “Indian Wars.” |

|   |
|---|
|# **Summarizing Question 2**<br><br>If Wounded Knee was the end of “Indian freedom,” what happened after?  How did the U.S. government continue to treat Native Americans?  Did the fighting stop completely?  What happened to the Sioux and other tribes after they lost their land?  How did these events affect Native American culture and traditions over time?  Do the effects of these events still impact Native American communities today?|
