# [[Unit 3]]

Here are some key concepts that are relevant to understanding cultural divergence, explained briefly:

* **Acculturation:** The process of cultural change that occurs when two or more cultures come into contact. It involves the adoption of certain aspects of a dominant culture by a subordinate culture, but often without complete assimilation.  

* **Assimilation:** The process by which a minority group gradually adopts the culture of the dominant group, often leading to the loss of the minority group's distinct cultural identity.  This is a more complete form of cultural change than acculturation. 

* **Multiculturalism:** A societal condition in which different ethnic and cultural groups coexist within a society, maintaining their distinct identities while participating in the larger social and political system.  Multiculturalism contrasts with assimilation, emphasizing cultural diversity and tolerance.

* **Nativism:**  A political ideology characterized by the belief that native inhabitants of a country are superior to immigrants and should have preferential treatment. This ideology often fuels cultural divergence and conflict, as it actively resists the integration of immigrant cultures. 

* **Syncretism:** The blending of elements from two or more different cultures to create something new.  While seemingly a form of convergence, syncretism can also contribute to divergence if the resulting hybrid culture remains distinct from either of its parent cultures.  


# Cultural Divergence: A Clash of Cultures

Cultural divergence refers to the process by which different cultures become increasingly dissimilar over time.  This contrasts with cultural convergence, where cultures become more alike.  Divergence can be driven by a variety of factors, often leading to the reinforcement of cultural identities and the creation of distinct cultural landscapes.

## Factors Contributing to Cultural Divergence

Several factors contribute to cultural divergence:

* **Isolation:** Geographical barriers, such as mountains, deserts, or oceans, can limit contact between different groups, allowing their cultures to develop independently.  This is clearly seen in the development of unique island cultures.

* **Technological advancements:** Ironically, technological advancements can sometimes *increase* cultural divergence. While globalization connects people, niche technologies and online communities can foster the preservation and growth of smaller, distinct cultural groups, allowing them to maintain their unique traditions and perspectives.

* **Political conflict and colonialism:**  Periods of conflict or colonial rule can lead to the deliberate suppression of certain cultures and the reinforcement of others, ultimately resulting in greater cultural differences between groups.  The impact of colonialism often leads to lasting cultural divergence between colonizer and colonized populations.

* **Religious differences:**  Differing religious beliefs and practices can create significant cultural divides, influencing values, social structures, and daily life.  

* **Economic disparities:**  Significant economic inequalities can lead to social stratification and the development of separate cultural practices among different socioeconomic groups within the same region.
