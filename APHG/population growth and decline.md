## AP Human Geography: Population Growth & Decline Notes

### Global Population Trends

* **Historical Growth:**
    * 1800: 1 billion people (after 40,000 years of human existence)
    * Present: 8.3 billion people (rapid growth in the last 200 years)
* **Current Trend:** Overall global growth rate is declining.

### Measuring Population Growth

* **Crude Birth Rate (CBR):** Number of live births per 1,000 people per year. 
    * Example: A CBR of 20 means 20 births for every 1,000 people in a year.
* **[[Total Fertility Rate]] (TFR):** Average number of children a woman will have in her lifetime.
    * Historically high (around 6) due to high child mortality.
    * Currently around 2.1 globally.

### Factors Influencing TFR

* **Development Level:**
    * Developed countries: TFR generally below 2.1 (e.g., US - 2, Japan - under 2).
    * Developing countries: TFR generally higher (4-6 or more).
* **Industrial Revolution:** Led to increased food production, lower death rates, and eventually lower TFRs in Europe.
* **Women's Education and Empowerment:** 
    * Increased education and workplace equality correlate with lower TFRs (e.g., Japan).
    * Example: Between 1990-2007, TFR in developing nations dropped significantly as female education levels rose.
* **Economic Development:** Economic stability and security can lead to families choosing to have fewer children.

### The [[Demographic Transition Model]]

Describes the shift in population growth patterns as a country industrializes.

* **Stage 1 (Pre-industrial):** High CBR, high death rates, slow population growth.
* **Stage 2 (Early Industrial):** High CBR, declining death rates, rapid population growth.
* **Stage 3 (Late Industrial):** Declining CBR, low death rates, slowing population growth.
* **Stage 4 (Post-industrial):** Low CBR, low death rates, stable or declining population.

### Consequences of Later Childbirth

* **Potential Increase in:**
    * Mental illnesses and birth defects in children.
    * Difficulties conceiving and higher infertility rates in women.

### Food Production and Population

* **Agricultural Density:** Number of farmers per unit of arable land.
    * High agricultural density suggests lower efficiency in food production.
    * Low agricultural density suggests higher efficiency and technology use (e.g., US).
* **Technological Advancements:**  Improved agricultural technology increases efficiency, requiring fewer farmers and producing more food.

### Public Health and Life Expectancy

* **Industrialization and Urbanization:** Initially led to poor sanitation and disease outbreaks (e.g., cholera, plague).
	* Stage 2/3
* **Public Sanitation Improvements:** Sewer systems, water treatment, and hygiene practices drastically increased life expectancy. 
	* Stage 3
