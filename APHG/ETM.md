# [[APHG Unit [[2]]

The Epidemiological Transition Model ([[ETM]]) describes the changing patterns of disease and death within a population over time. It closely aligns with the [[Demographic Transition Model]] (DTM), illustrating how population health shifts alongside population growth and development.

**Where it fits in the [[Demographic Transition Model]]:**

The [[ETM]] is considered a **sub-model** of the DTM. It complements the DTM's focus on population growth and age structure by explaining the **corresponding changes in disease profiles**.  

**Stages of the Epidemiological Transition Model:**

**Stage [[1]]: Age of Pestilence and Famine (High Mortality)**

* **Characteristics:**  
    * High death rates from infectious diseases (e.g., plague, smallpox, cholera)
    * Famine and malnutrition are common
    * Life expectancy is low (around 30 years)
    * Limited access to sanitation and healthcare
    * Corresponds to Stage [[1]] of the DTM (high birth and death rates)

**Stage [[2]]: Age of Receding Pandemics (Declining Mortality)**

* **Characteristics:** 
    * Improved sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition
    * Infectious diseases decline, but still prevalent
    * Life expectancy increases (40-50 years)
    * Emergence of chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease)
    * Corresponds to Stage [[2]] of the DTM (declining death rates, high birth rates)

**Stage [[3]]: Age of Degenerative and Man-Made Diseases (Moderating Mortality)**

* **Characteristics:** 
    * Further decline in infectious diseases
    * Rise in chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, cancer, diabetes)
    * Life expectancy continues to increase (60-70 years)
    * Increased emphasis on healthcare and preventative measures
    * Corresponds to Stage [[3]] of the DTM (declining birth rates, low death rates)

**Stage [[4]]: Age of Delayed Degenerative Diseases (Low Mortality)**

* **Characteristics:**
    * Further decline in chronic diseases due to advancements in medicine and lifestyle changes
    * Increased life expectancy (70+ years)
    * Focus on extending healthy lifespan
    * Emergence of new health challenges like lifestyle-related diseases and mental health issues
    * Corresponds to Stage [[4]] of the DTM (low birth and death rates, stable population)

**Stage [[5]] (Hypothetical): Age of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (High Mortality)**

* **Characteristics:**
    * Potential rise in infectious diseases due to factors like antibiotic resistance, globalization, and environmental changes
    * Increased risk of pandemics
    * This stage is hypothetical and has not yet been fully realized.

**Key Points:**

* The [[ETM]] highlights the dynamic nature of disease patterns and the importance of public health interventions.
* The stages are not always linear and can vary between countries and populations.
* Factors like economic development, access to healthcare, and environmental conditions influence the transition process.
