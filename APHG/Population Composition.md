# Population Composition: What a population is made of 

## Things populations are made of
### [[Ethnicity]] - You get Chinatowns and little italies everywhere
- You get your black neighborhoods and your white neighborhoods
- Basically people just like to cluster with people who are similar to them
### Scales and distribution
[[Population Distribution]] 

### Age Structure
[[Population Pyramids]]
- If you have a lot of kids you won't have the taxes to support them

- This map has many direct correlations to the child conscription
	- Child conscription directly correlates to polygamy
		- Young (single) teens are told by older men who have multiple wives that they should be soldiers so they can be like them, a lot of those child soldiers die in war, and the ones who are still alive get multiple wives. Very interesting population dynamic
