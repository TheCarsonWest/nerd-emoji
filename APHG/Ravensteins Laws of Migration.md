# [[Unit 2b Migration]]

E.G. Ravenstein, a 19th-century geographer, formulated a set of laws to describe migration patterns. These laws, known as Ravenstein's Laws of Migration, remain relevant today, providing a foundational understanding of human movement across space.

Key Laws:

# 1: Most migrants move only a short distance:
-  This distance decay principle suggests that migration decreases with increasing distance.  People are more likely to move to nearby locations due to familiar environments, lower transportation costs, and easier communication.
- Its easier to move short distances than long distances, duh
# 2: Migrants who move longer distances tend to go to large cities: 
- This highlights the role of pull factors like economic opportunities and urban amenities in attracting migrants from further afield.
- Why tf would you move across the world to farm corn bruh
# 3: Migration occurs in steps: 
- People often migrate in stages, moving first to a nearby town or city before venturing further. This is especially true for rural-to-urban migration and reflects a gradual process of adapting to new environments.
# 4: Each migration flow produces a counter-migration: 
- For every migration stream, there is an opposing flow. This highlights the push-pull factors that influence migration, with people moving in response to both positive and negative conditions in their origin and destination areas.
- Kinda just a bs rule to cover our asses
	- Mexico to US: Mexicans want to go to estados unidos to escape el cartelo
	- US to Mexico: Retired Americans to to Mexico (really just Cancun) for the warm weather and cheap prices
- **Return Migration**: People have had enough of the country they move to, and come back once 
	- Lebanon -> Turkey -> Lebanon (-> Turkey?)
	- [Beirut Explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Inzz0iKcB9c) + Inflation + bank run, people leave the country
	- Things are stablilizing so people came back
	- Hezbollah decided to poke the lion's balls and now they are involved with the Hamas War, so everyone is back to being gone
- Chain Migration
	- Outlier
	- When one person leaves, and then the whole squad comes over
		- Dad leaves for job
		- Mom comes back with the kids
# 5: Most migrants are young adults: 
- This reflects the life cycle stage where individuals are most likely to be seeking employment, education, or family opportunities.
# 6: Males are more likely to migrate than females:
- Men are more ambitious than women and are much more likely to take a big risk by moving 
- Indians moving to dubai to work in construction until they die creates the 3:1 male:female ratio
# 7: Most moves are economic
- tryna get the bag
- not much more to say
