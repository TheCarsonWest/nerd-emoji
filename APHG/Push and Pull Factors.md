[[Unit 2b Migration]]
# Push and pull factors are reasons people migrate
* Cultural: (e.g., religious freedom)
* Demographic: (e.g., unbalanced sex ratios, overpopulation)
* Economic: (e.g., jobs)
* Environmental: (e.g., natural disasters)
* Political: (e.g., persecution)

**Push factors are often negative** (e.g., poor economic conditions, warfare), while **pull factors are often perceived as positive** (e.g., a better quality of life, economic opportunities).

## CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF MIGRATION
* **Migration is the permanent or semi-permanent relocation of people from one place to another**.
* Early humans were highly mobile, searching for food and hunting grounds.
* As agriculture and urban settlement developed, people began to settle down.

## TERMINOLOGY

* **Immigration is migration to a location**, while **emigration is migration from a location**.
* The **difference between immigrants and emigrants is called net migration**.
* **Positive net migration** (more immigrants than emigrants) leads to net in-migration.
* **Negative net migration** (more emigrants than immigrants) leads to net out-migration.


## MIGRATIONâ€™S PUSH AND PULL FACTORS

* **Voluntary migration is the most common type of migration**, driven by the desire for a better life.
* **The decision to migrate usually involves push factors** (reasons for leaving) and pull factors (reasons for going).
## Economic [[Push and Pull Factors]] * **Lack of jobs** and economic opportunities are the most common reasons for migration.
* Largest country-to-country migration flows (2005-2010):
    * Most flows originate and/or end in Asia.
### Examples
* Rust Belt
	* Nobody wants to live in Gary [[Indiana]] so they left for the south
* [[Gilded Age]]
	* America: "trust me bro we are so much better than europe bro PLEASE move here I swear youll live better"
	* Europeans actually believed this
	* Now everyone lives in a windowless apartment in the Bronx with 15 hour shifts in a  cotton mill

## Social [[Push and Pull Factors]] 
* Discrimination and persecution based on ethnicity, race, gender, or [[religion]] can drive migration.
### Examples
* Mormons
	* People didn't like the false prophet worshippers, and they frequently battled on the streets of the midwest
		* Joseph Smith was hung for treason against the state of [[Illinois]]
	* Those heretics got pushed out to [[Utah]] where their ancient hyperintellegent Israelite civilizations apparently lived
	* List of Latter Day Saints in heaven:
		* 
		* 
* Holocaust
	* Nazi Germany didn't want Jewish people anymore
	* Jews left as not to be killed
* Rwanda
	* The short people killed the tall people
	* Very recent

## Political [[Push and Pull Factors]] 
* Persecution, arrest, and discrimination due to opposing government policies can lead to migration.
### Examples
- Cuba
	- Who tf wants to be communist
	- Everyone leaves the first chance they get
	- Now Cubans are a majority demographic in certain counties in [[Florida]]
- China
	- Communist
	- A lot of olympians would defect the country from the olympics
- North Korea
	- Communist
- USSR
	- Communist
	- A lot of olympians would defect the country from the olympics

## Environmental [[Push and Pull Factors]] 
* Natural disasters, drought, and unfavorable conditions can force people to migrate.

### Examples:
* Nepal earthquake, Tsunami in Japan, Tsunami in Indonesia: Displaced populations
* Desertification: Deterioration of land to a desert-like condition due to human actions. This forces people to migrate from drylands in Africa.
* Flooding: Events like the 2011 [[Mississippi]] River flooding and Jakarta, Indonesia flooding force people from their homes.

## Demographic [[Push and Pull Factors]] 
* Demographic imbalances can influence migration:
    * Gender:  Young adults may migrate due to unbalanced sex ratios, difficulty finding a spouse.
    * Overpopulation: A young population can strain resources and lead to migration.
