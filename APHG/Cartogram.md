** [[Cartogram]]**

* A map in which the size of a region is distorted to represent a particular variable, such as population or economic activity.
* Used to emphasize spatial patterns and relationships that may not be apparent on a standard map.
* Can be used to compare different variables across regions or to show the distribution of a variable over time.
* Types of cartograms include:
 * Contiguous cartograms: preserve the adjacency of regions.
 * Non-contiguous cartograms: do not preserve adjacency.
* Advantages:
 * Can convey complex spatial data in a visually appealing way.
 * Can highlight disparities and patterns that may not be evident on a regular map.
* Disadvantages:
 * Can distort the actual shape and size of regions.
 * Can be difficult to interpret and compare to other maps.
