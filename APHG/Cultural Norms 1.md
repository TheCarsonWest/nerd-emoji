This is an essay

If Willy Wonka’s plan with his golden tickets was to pick out the most successful heir to his company following his retirement, contrary to how it played out in the movies, it could be argued that Mike Teevee would be the most effective leader of Wonka’s chocolate empire. While his brashness and video game addictions are noted, a deeper look inside of Mike Teevee shows the characteristics of a highly successful businessman. Mike Teevee’s superior intelligence, his current lack of purpose, and his inherent curiosity coupled with risk-taking behavior would make him an ideal candidate for one of the most innovative companies on the planet.

As proven with his appearance in the movie, Mike is shown to have superior intelligence to his peers at the chocolate factory. While the other children found their tickets through brute force, the case for Veruca, Augustus, and Violet, and pure luck in the case of Charlie, Mike found his ticket with a single chocolate bar. He did this by “analyzing both the Nikkei Index and the date codes of the other ticket finds, offset by the weather that day, and then calculating the location of the next ticket” he effectively cracked the code on where the golden ticket was with his sheer analytical prowess. This problem solving ability, and the obsessive behavior it likely took to do such a feat, proves Mike Teevee to have the talent it would take to lead Wonka’s global confectionery empire.

This remarkable intelligence, however, is shown to be underutilized in Mike's current life, leading to his portrayed video game addiction. While this could be interpreted as childish compulsiveness, it could also be seen as an outlet for his intellectual boredom. His schoolwork likely doesn’t present any challenge to him, and because of this he has been found to seek another form of mental engagement in the form of video games. Leading Willy Wonka’s factory could be the complex challenge in life that he currently lacks, and could be a productive output for his untapped potential. 

Furthermore, Mike possesses the curiosity and willingness to take risks that could mirror that of Willy Wonka himself. His downfall in the movie, which was his decision to teleport himself using the Television Chocolate Machine, while reckless, stemmed from his curiosity of the machine, which his knowledge of science told him was impossible. Rather than just accepting Wonka’s claim, Mike tested the machine on himself, a significant personal risk, to verify the truth. This is reminiscent of Wonka’s own reckless youth, foretold in his expeditions to the jungles of loompaland, and his experimentation on candy with unpredictable side effects. Their shared curiosity and risk-taking behavior further suggest that, with the proper mentoring, Mike Teevee would be a fine successor to Willy Wonka himself, continuing in his footsteps with more innovations in confectioneries that define the business Wonka created.

Typical responses that earn 3 points: • Uniformly offer evidence to support claims. • Focus on the importance of specific details to build an argument. • Organize an argument as a line of reasoning composed of multiple supporting claims. • Commentary may fail to integrate some evidence or fail to support a key claim. Typical responses that earn 4 points: • Uniformly offer evidence to support claims. • Focus on the importance of specific details to build an argument. • Organize and support an argument as a line of reasoning composed of multiple supporting claims, each with adequate evidence that is clearly explained.

This is an essay

If Willy Wonka’s plan with his golden tickets was to pick out the most successful heir to his company following his retirement, contrary to how it played out in the movies, it could be argued that Mike Teevee would be the most effective leader of Wonka’s chocolate empire.  **This is not simply due to his technological aptitude, but because** Mike Teevee’s superior intelligence, his current lack of purpose, and his inherent curiosity coupled with risk-taking behavior **align perfectly with the demands of leading** one of the most innovative companies on the planet.

As proven with his appearance in the movie, Mike is shown to have superior intelligence to his peers at the chocolate factory. While the other children found their tickets through brute force, **as seen with** the case for Veruca, Augustus, and Violet, and pure luck in the case of Charlie, Mike found his ticket with a single chocolate bar. He did this by “analyzing both the Nikkei Index and the date codes of the other ticket finds, offset by the weather that day, and then calculating the location of the next ticket.” He effectively cracked the code on where the golden ticket was with his sheer analytical prowess.  **This analytical ability isn't just about finding a ticket; it demonstrates a strategic mind capable of complex problem-solving, a crucial skill for navigating the intricacies of a global business like Wonka's.** This problem-solving ability, and the obsessive behavior it likely took to do such a feat, proves Mike Teevee to have the talent it would take to lead Wonka’s global confectionery empire.

This remarkable intelligence, however, is shown to be underutilized in Mike's current life, leading to his portrayed video game addiction. While this could be interpreted as childish compulsiveness, it could also be seen as an outlet for his intellectual boredom. His schoolwork likely doesn’t present any challenge to him, and because of this he has been found to seek another form of mental engagement in the form of video games.  **This suggests that Mike thrives on challenges and seeks constant stimulation. Leading Willy Wonka’s factory, with its inherent complexities and constant need for innovation, would provide the perfect outlet for his restless intellect, transforming his perceived "addiction" into a driving force for success.** Leading Willy Wonka’s factory could be the complex challenge in life that he currently lacks, and could be a productive output for his untapped potential. 

Furthermore, Mike possesses the curiosity and willingness to take risks that could mirror that of Willy Wonka himself. His downfall in the movie, which was his decision to teleport himself using the Television Chocolate Machine, while reckless, stemmed from his curiosity of the machine, which his knowledge of science told him was impossible. Rather than just accepting Wonka’s claim, Mike tested the machine on himself, a significant personal risk, to verify the truth. **This act, while impulsive, showcases a crucial trait for an innovator: a refusal to accept the status quo and a drive to push boundaries.** This is reminiscent of Wonka’s own reckless youth, foretold in his expeditions to the jungles of loompaland, and his experimentation on candy with unpredictable side effects.  **This shared penchant for experimentation, while potentially dangerous, is the engine of Wonka's success.  Mike, under Wonka's guidance, could learn to channel this impulse towards productive innovation, developing new products and processes that would keep Wonka's at the forefront of the confectionery industry.** Their shared curiosity and risk-taking behavior further suggest that, with the proper mentoring, Mike Teevee would be a fine successor to Willy Wonka himself, continuing in his footsteps with more innovations in confectioneries that define the business Wonka created.


**Revised Essay Scoring:**

* **Thesis (0-[[1 points):** [[1 point.  The thesis remains clear and defensible.
* **Evidence and Commentary (0-4 points):** 4 points. The added commentary strengthens the connection between the evidence and the overall argument, creating a clear line of reasoning.  The analysis now fully explains *how* the evidence supports the claim about Mike's potential as a leader.
* **Sophistication (0-[[1 points):** [[1 point.  By acknowledging the potential downsides of Mike's personality (recklessness) and explaining how these could be channeled into positive traits under Wonka's mentorship, the essay demonstrates a more nuanced and complex understanding of the situation.


By strengthening the commentary and adding nuance to the argument, the revised essay effectively addresses the rubric's criteria and achieves a higher score.
