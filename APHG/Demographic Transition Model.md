This model illustrates the shifts in birth rates, death rates, and population growth as societies develop.

| Stage                   | Birth Rate  | Death Rate  | Population Growth               | Key Characteristics                                                                       | Examples                                                                            |

**Factors Driving the Transition:**

* **Industrialization & [[Urbanization]]:** Shift from agricultural to industrial economies.
* **Medical Advancements:** Improved sanitation, healthcare, and disease control.
* **Economic Development:** Higher living standards, education, and women's empowerment.
* **Social & Cultural Changes:** Smaller family sizes, later marriages, career focus.
* **Government Policies:**  Influence population growth (e.g., family planning programs).

### [[2]]. Epidemiologic Transition Model

This model explains the leading causes of death in each stage of the demographic transition.

| **[[3]]. Degenerative Diseases**         | Chronic illnesses like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes rise due to lifestyle changes. |
| **[[4]]. Delayed Degenerative Diseases** | Medical advancements prolong life, delaying the onset of chronic diseases.                |
| **[[5]]. (Potential)**                   | Re-emergence of infectious diseases due to antibiotic resistance and globalization.       |

### Important Statistics:

* **[[Total Fertility Rate]] (TFR):** Average number of children per woman.
* **Replacement Rate:** TFR of [[2]].[[1]] needed for a stable population.
* **[[Infant Mortality Rate]] (IMR):** Number of infant deaths per [[1]],000 live births.
* **Zero Population Growth (ZPG):** Birth rate equals death rate.
* **[[Migration]]:** Movement of people within and between countries, impacting [[population distribution]].

### Key Takeaways:

* Global population growth is uneven. Some regions experience rapid growth (e.g., Africa), while others face decline (e.g., Japan, Europe).
* Understanding the demographic and epidemiologic transitions helps explain these trends and their consequences.
* Economic development, healthcare access, social change, and globalization all shape population dynamics and health outcomes. 

what is the changes in lifestyle seen in demographic transiotion model stage [[4]]?a

 Here's a breakdown of lifestyle changes typically observed in Stage [[4]] of the [[Demographic Transition Model]], along with the reasons behind them:

**Stage [[4]]: Low Stationary Stage**

**Key Demographic Characteristics:**

* **Low Birth Rates:** Birth rates stabilize at low levels, often near or below the replacement rate (the number of births needed to maintain a stable population).
* **Low Death Rates:** Death rates remain low and stable due to continued advancements in healthcare, sanitation, and living standards.
* **Very Low Population Growth:**  With birth and death rates both low, population growth is minimal or even stagnant.

**Lifestyle Changes:**
[[APHG Unit 2]]
* **Increased Focus on Individualism and Personal Fulfillment:** With smaller family sizes, individuals often have more time and resources to pursue personal goals, education, careers, and leisure activities.
* **Later Marriages and Childbearing:** People tend to delay marriage and parenthood, prioritizing education, career establishment, and financial stability.
* **Higher Levels of Education, Especially for Women:**  Access to education, particularly for women, becomes more widespread, contributing to greater economic independence and changing family dynamics.
* **Increased [[Urbanization]]:** People continue to migrate to urban areas in search of job opportunities and a different lifestyle.
* **Aging Population:**  With low birth rates and longer life expectancies, the proportion of older adults in the population increases significantly. This leads to:
    * **Greater Demand for Healthcare and Social Services:**  Societies need to adapt to support an aging population with increased healthcare needs.
    * **Shifts in Workforce Dynamics:**  A smaller pool of younger workers may lead to labor shortages and a need to adjust retirement ages.
* **Emphasis on Sustainability and Environmental Concerns:**  With a stable or slowly growing population, there's often a greater awareness of resource consumption and environmental impact, leading to more sustainable practices.
* **Technological Advancements:** Stage [[4]] societies often experience rapid technological advancements, influencing communication, work, and leisure activities.

**Examples of Countries in Stage [[4]]:**

Japan, Italy, Germany, South Korea, and many other developed countries are currently in or approaching Stage [[4]].

**Important Note:**  While these trends are common in Stage [[4]] societies, there can be variations within and between countries due to cultural, economic, and political factors.
