**14.1 Consequences of Agricultural Practices: Altering the Environment**

*   **Overall Theme:** Agricultural practices, driven by the need to feed a growing global population, significantly alter landscapes, both positively and negatively, with lasting environmental and societal consequences.

*   **Agricultural Landscapes:** These are landscapes that result from the interactions between farming activities and a location's natural environment. They can be long-standing or constantly changing.

*   **Shifting Cultivation:**
    *   Practiced in peripheral/semi-peripheral countries (South America, Africa, Southeast Asia).
    *   Involves farming land until infertile, then abandoning it.
    *   Differs from crop rotation; focuses on land recovery.
    *   Can lead to soil degradation if fallow periods are insufficient.
    *   Can be part of a sustainable agroecosystem when managed well.
    *   Example: Ban Tat community in Vietnam.

*   **Slash and Burn:**
    *   Considered a type of shifting cultivation, but can permanently alter landscapes.
    *   Common in tropical wet climates.
    *   Involves cutting/burning forests to create fields.
    *   Ash provides nutrients, but soil fertility is quickly depleted.
    *   Contributes to deforestation and soil erosion.
    *   Can be sustainable if practiced by small populations, with adequate land recovery time.
    *   Example: Hin Lad Nai village in Thailand.

*   **Terracing:**
    *   Carving hillsides into level growing plots.
    *   Used in mountainous areas, including tropical wet climates.
    *   Creates paddies for water-intensive crops (e.g., rice).
    *   Preserves soil nutrients and slows rainwater runoff.
    *   Labor-intensive but can make unusable land productive.
    *   Critical to maintain to prevent runoff and mudslides.
    *   Example: Ifugao Rice Terraces in the Philippines.

*   **Irrigation:**
    *   Supplements rainfall by bringing water to fields.
    *   Transforms arid/semi-arid landscapes.
    *   Supports both subsistence and commercial farms.
    *   Reservoirs (artificial lakes) and rerouted water paths are common.
    *   **Aral Sea Example:** Diversion of rivers for cotton irrigation led to drastic shrinkage and ecological damage.
    *   **Colorado River Example:** Heavily dammed and used for irrigation, serving millions of people and farmland; threatened by agricultural demands and dams' effects.
    *   **Ogallala Aquifer Example:** Overdrawn, leading to water level declines in the Great Plains.
    *   **China Example:** Groundwater irrigation leads to CO2 emissions; South-to-North Water Diversion Project faces criticism for being less effective than agricultural water conservation.
    *   Increased food production demands will strain water sources; better water management is crucial.

*   **Draining Wetlands:**
    *   Historically viewed as acceptable to create farmland.
    *   Netherlands is a prime example of wetland reclamation.
    *   Results in habitat loss, increased flood damage, reduced water quality, and release of stored carbon.
    *   Example: Palm oil plantations in Malaysia.
    *   Significant wetland loss in the U.S.
    *   Australia is working with farmers to adopt sustainable practices.

*   **Pastoral Nomadism:**
    *   Extensive practice, generally subsistence agriculture.
    *   Herders move animals seasonally for grazing.
    *   Practiced in dry climates (Southwest Asia, North Africa, Arctic).
    *   Traditional practices aim to preserve resources.
    *   Disruption can lead to land degradation, overgrazing, and desertification.
    *   Can impact biodiversity and cause soil erosion.
    *   Evolving due to modernization and urbanization.
    *   **Mongolia Example:** Migration patterns remain the same, despite using motorcycles.
    *   **Tuareg Example:** Cattle-dependent nomads in the Sahara struggling due to declining rainfall and overgrazing around wells.
