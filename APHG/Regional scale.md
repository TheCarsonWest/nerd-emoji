- The regional scale is an intermediate level of analysis that falls between the local and global scales.
- It typically encompasses a group of states, provinces, or other subnational units within a country or a region of the world.
- The regional scale allows for the examination of patterns and processes that occur across a larger area than the local scale but are not as broad as those at the global scale.
- Examples of regional-scale phenomena include regional economic disparities, patterns of migration, and the distribution of natural resources.
