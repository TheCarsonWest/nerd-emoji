Would you still love me if we were down bad and out a home?  
I made all my money singin' so sad and lonely songs  
But all my diamonds came from dirt  
The more I love you, the less I hurt  
And now my pen can't find the words

I wrote songs about sinnin', evil women, pills, and cars  
I wrote songs about drinkin' 'til you walked in and raised the bar  
But who am I to write rock bottom from the highs you took me to?  
Thank God I was right about you

You can say you hate me as long as you don't mean it  
Maybe go half crazy, don't need a rhyme or reason  
Girl, you can go and pick a fight, slam that door and lock me outside  
Just for one night so I can find a brand new melody

I wrote songs about sinnin', evil women, pills, and cars  
I wrote songs about drinkin' 'til you walked in and raised the bar  
But who am I to write rock bottom from the highs you took me to?  
Thank God I was right about you

I could change up all the chords, get my fingers flowin' free  
But as long as you're with me, I can have my harmony

I wrote songs about sinnin', evil women, pills, and cars  
I wrote songs about drinkin' 'til you walked in and raised the bar  
But who am I to write rock bottom from the highs you took me to?  
Thank God I was right about you

Thank God I was right about you

| Post Malone (Singer) | To express his gratitude and love for his partner, highlighting how she has positively impacted his life and artistic expression. He also wants to reassure her of his love and commitment. | His romantic partner; potentially also his fans who relate to themes of love and personal transformation. | A relationship characterized by significant positive change in the singer's life.  He's reflecting on his past struggles and contrasting them with his current happiness. | The singer's past struggles and self-destructive behaviors, juxtaposed with the transformative effect his partner has had on him. This creates a need to express his gratitude and love. | Uses a heartfelt and vulnerable tone; employs repetition of the core message ("Thank God I was right about you"); utilizes metaphors (diamonds from dirt, raising the bar); creates a contrast between his past and present; uses relatable imagery of conflict in a relationship ("pick a fight, slam that door"). | Primarily emotional appeal (evokes feelings of love, gratitude, and relief); also uses some ethical appeal (presents himself as a changed person because of his partner). | Affectionate, grateful, vulnerable, reflective, hopeful, slightly apologetic (for his past).  The overall tone is overwhelmingly positive. |
