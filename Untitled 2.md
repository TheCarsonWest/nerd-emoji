Okay, here's a breakdown of the questions and how you can approach answering them for the Mango, based on the provided template:

**Title: Untitled 2 (Mango)** (I've added "Mango" for clarity)

**Starred Blocks:**

**1.  What is the name of the fruit you are bringing, or any nicknames associated with it?**

*   **MangOoOOOOOOO** (You've already answered this!  You can expand on it.  Maybe add some real nicknames beyond the fun one.  Consider "King of Fruits," "Mango," "Aam" (common in South Asia).  You could also mention specific varieties like "Alphonso" or "Tommy Atkins" if you plan to focus on a particular type.)

**2. What part of the world did this fruit originate from? Eastern South Asia**

*   **Eastern South Asia** (You've answered this! You could be a little more specific.  India is generally considered the origin. You could say something like: "India, specifically the Eastern regions and parts of Myanmar and Bangladesh.")

**3. How long does it take for your fruit to grow?**

*   (This refers to the time from flowering to fruit maturity.)
    *   **Answer:** This varies greatly depending on the variety and growing conditions. Generally, it takes about **3-6 months** from flowering to harvest. Different varieties have different maturation periods.

**4. How long does it take your fruit from being picked to appearing on market shelves?**

*   (This is about transportation and shelf life.)
    *   **Answer:** This depends on several factors:  Distance to market, transportation methods (air, sea, land), and storage conditions.  For locally grown mangoes, it could be as little as a few days.  For imported mangoes, it can be **1-4 weeks**, sometimes longer.  Ripening agents might be used to speed up the process.
