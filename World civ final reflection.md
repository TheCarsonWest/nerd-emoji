History of England - The 100 Years War - Part 1 - Extra History
```

**The Hundred Years War: A Defining Conflict**

*clears throat*

The Hundred Years War. The words conjure images of chivalry and pageantry: knights in gleaming armor, jousting at tournaments; the legendary English archer decimating the ranks of French nobility; the iconic battles of Crécy, Poitiers, and Agincourt. Yet, behind the romanticized vision lies a stark reality – the brutal face of the Middle Ages. It was a period marked by senseless warfare, devastating destruction, and the tragic loss of countless lives in the muddy fields of France, all fueled by the greed and ambition of kings.

The Hundred Years War encompasses all these elements. It's a story of courage, the clash of nations, and the timeless struggle for supremacy. But it's also something more profound: the story of a war that helped define England. It shaped her sense of national identity, molded her language, and cemented her role on the world stage. The Hundred Years War, in essence, helped forge a nation.

**A Throne Usurped, a King Determined**

The year is 1328. A young man sits on the throne of England, Edward III. But he is powerless. His mother's lover, Roger Mortimer, has seized control. However, Edward possesses the heart of a warrior and the mind of a leader. In 1330, at the tender age of 17, he gathers his loyal friends and, under the cloak of pale moonlight, infiltrates Mortimer's castle. They cut down the guards and seize Mortimer himself. The interloper is dragged through the jeering crowds of London to the infamous Tyburn tree, where countless traitors would meet their end. There, he is hanged until dead.

From that moment forward, Edward is determined to make England and his royal court a shining beacon of culture for all of Christendom. His court becomes a vibrant spectacle of color, music, tournaments, and poetry. He surrounds himself with the wealthiest nobles and models his court on the mythical Camelot of King Arthur, embracing the cult of chivalry. But inherent to this cult is the expectation that the King will lead his nobles to war, seeking wealth and glory.

While the nobility occasionally chafed under the King's authority, they remained, for the most part, his natural allies. They held their lands from him and collaborated in governing the kingdom and its people. And so, with his most powerful nobles at his side, Edward embarked on what he loved most and for what he was born: he led his nobility to war and crushed the Scots in battle.

**France at the Gates**

But in 1337, Edward's world faced a new threat: the French were at the gates. Well, not literally at the gates of England. The situation was far more complex, rooted in centuries of medieval inheritance law and international politics. To unravel this tangled web, we need to delve into the intricate history of the French and English royal dynasties, who had been fighting over land in France for centuries.

In the blue corner, we have the French royal dynasty: the Valois. And in the red corner, the English royal dynasty: the Plantagenets. King Philip VI of France, representing the Valois, was determined to wrest the last of Edward's French lands away from him. Medieval kingdoms did not adhere to modern borders or rules; they were the property of a King and his nobles.

English claims in France stretched back to 1066, when William the Bastard, a French noble, decided he deserved more than his lands in Normandy. He capitalized on a distant claim to the English throne, crossed the English Channel, conquered the English, and became known to history as William the Conqueror. The old Anglo-Saxon landowners were swept aside, and England became the property of French-speaking lords. French became the language of the nobility, of literature, and of the King's Court, while English remained the language of peasants and serfs.

Fast forward a century, and in 1155, Henry of Anjou became King Henry II of England. More French land was added to the English holdings in Normandy that came from old Willy the Conq. Plus, Henry married Eleanor of Aquitaine, the richest heiress in Europe. She brought even more French land to the English crown. Henry and his successors, the Plantagenet royal family, now controlled almost half of modern France. They spoke French, loved France, and considered themselves French.

**Homage and Lip Service**

But there was a catch. Most of these lands were, in theory, still owned by the Kings of France. Like all medieval vassals, anyone with lands in France was supposed to kneel and pay homage to the Valois kings. In practice, powerful figures like William the Conqueror and Henry II were too powerful to be forced to obey the Valois. They merely paid lip service to the French King's theoretical rights and carried on as they pleased.

Over the centuries, however, the Valois used their rights to reclaim much of that land while weaker Plantagenets sat on the English throne. By the time Edward III was born, only a single province remained in English hands: Gascony. King Philip VI of France was determined to take that last province away from the Plantagenets.

Philip had no doubt that he could achieve this goal. France was, after all, the most powerful and glorious country in Christendom. It was a leading center of culture and learning. Philip considered only the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor as his equals. England, in contrast, was just a small, damp, and slightly grubby country somewhere in the North Sea. The French nobility considered themselves the shining example of chivalry, a status they did not grant to the English nobility.

Philip made trouble for Edward, forming an alliance with the Scots against the English. Then, in 1337, at his court, he formally confiscated Gascony. Edward attempted to negotiate, but Philip refused. Edward, in turn, vowed to defend his rights with the edge of his sword.

**The Wool Trade and the Flemish Alliance**

The confiscation of Gascony was not only an insult to Edward but also a threat to English merchants. England relied on two major sources of wealth: the wine trade with Gascony and the wool trade with the county of Flanders (modern-day Belgium). Both the Gascon merchants and the English dreaded the loss of the wine trade.

Even more important was the wool trade. The textile industry was by far the largest industry in medieval Europe, dwarfing all others except agriculture. This industry was dominated by the densely populated towns of northern Italy and Flanders. English wool, considered the best in Europe for its fineness and long strands, was the lifeblood of this industry. Every year, thousands of wool sacks were sold to Flemish merchants, and the customs duties generated by this trade filled the English treasury.

However, the Count of Flanders was a subject of the French King, and King Philip ordered Flanders to cease trading with the English. The Flemish were as horrified as the English. Without English wool, their industry would collapse, and their people would starve.

**A King's Claim, a Nation's Destiny**

One Friday, in the bustling market square of Ghent in Flanders, the people gathered around a wooden stage adorned with colorful pennants and flags. They noticed a new flag: the arms of England quartered with the royal arms of France. A young, powerful man stepped forward. He declared his name: King Edward the Third. He had been wrongfully banned from his lands in France, and he would reclaim his right. The people cheered.

But there was more. By the right of his French mother, he was claiming the very throne of France itself. The Flemish cheered. The French giggled.

War was now inevitable. On the English side, the stakes were high: trade, England's role in Christendom, the King's lands in France held for a century and a half, and the reputation and honor of the King. On the French side, the prize was equally significant: a unified country, national prestige, and the right of their monarch to his throne.

Join us next time as these two great kings marshal their forces and the Hundred Years War begins in earnest.

## Medieval Europe: Crash Course European History #1

## The Tumultuous Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries: Plague, War, and the Crumbling of Christendom

Medieval Europe often evokes images of disease, famine, and brutal warfare. While these images hold some truth, the era was far more complex than the popular narrative suggests. In this episode of Crash Course European History, John Green delves into the tumultuous 14th and 15th centuries, an era defined by the Black Death, the Hundred Years War, and the erosion of the Church's authority.

Let's start with a myth: people only drank beer. Beer and ale were nutritious beverages, there were wells with safe and delicious drinking water.

However, the 14th and 15th centuries saw the Black Death, the Great Schism in the Catholic Church, and the Hundred Years War. Also, the Little Ice Age began in the 14th century, leading to cooler temperatures and declining harvests, contributing to stunting and starvation.

**The Black Death: A Pandemic of Unimaginable Scale**

The Black Death, a devastating pandemic of Bubonic Plague, swept across Europe from Asia. Originating in Tibet, the disease spread through rats, mice, and fleas, hitching rides on human travelers. Thus, the plague was a product of growing human interconnectedness.

Bubonic plague is a horrific disease. The bacterium *Yersinia Pestis* causes lymph nodes to swell and sometimes burst, leading to high fevers, vomiting blood, and gangrene, which causes extremities and facial features to turn black with necrosis, hence "the Black Death." The mortality rate ranged from 50 to 60 percent.

Before the advent of antibiotics, the Black Death was devastating. By the time it reached Constantinople in 1347, around 25 million people had already perished in Asia. Within four years, Europe was decimated, with some areas losing up to 80 percent of their population. Historians estimate that around half of all Europeans died.

Giovanni Boccaccio described the horrors of the time, noting that "many died in the open street... Consecrated churchyards did not suffice for the burial of the vast multitude of bodies, which were heaped by the hundreds in vast trenches, ...like goods in a ship's hold."

**The Hundred Years War: A Protracted Struggle for Power**

Amidst the devastation of the Black Death, the Hundred Years War further destabilized Europe. Fought between England and France over control of continental territories, the war dragged on for at least 116 years, beginning in 1337.

The war exacerbated existing problems like poor harvests and disease outbreaks while simultaneously contributing to them. It also challenged long-held cultural beliefs, such as the Code of Chivalry, a set of behaviors for knightly opponents.

Initially, chivalry dictated treating fellow knights with respect and trust, holding them for ransom rather than killing them. However, English kings began hiring mercenaries who looted and plundered, undermining these noble ideals. Some mercenaries even continued marauding during truces and peace treaties.

The Hundred Years War also brought about innovation, with non-aristocratic soldiers from England and Wales utilizing the longbow, famed for its combined deadly speed and accuracy. The French innovated with cannons on ships, which the English later adapted for land battles. Gunpowder, a Chinese invention, powered both types of cannons.

The war also witnessed the rise and fall of Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl who led French forces to victory against the English. However, she was captured by the Burgundians, turned over to the English, and burned at the stake in 1431.

**The Comforts of Religion Undermined: The Great Schism**

European life in the 14th and 15th centuries was undeniably harsh. Violent crime was rampant, the risk of dying in war was high, and malnutrition and child mortality were common.

The Church, meant to provide solace, also faced internal struggles. The question of whether the Church or kings held ultimate authority led to conflict. Pope Boniface VIII asserted the Church's supremacy, but King Philip IV of France challenged his authority.

Philip had the Pope kidnapped, and after his release, he died in 1303. By 1305, Philip orchestrated the election of a French Pope and his installation in Avignon, France, leading to the perception that the papacy was under French control.

In 1377, Pope Gregory XI moved back to Rome, but his death led to the election of two rival Popes, one in Rome and one in Avignon, marking the Great Schism.

This disunity weakened the Church's spiritual authority, compounded by the clergy's inability to provide guidance during the Black Death. People like Catherine of Siena, an ordinary young woman of intense religious faith, emerged as spiritual leaders. She successfully urged Pope Gregory XI to return to Rome.

The Great Schism ended in 1417 with the election of a single Pope, Martin V. However, the damage was done, and the Church's authority was undermined.

**The Decline of Christendom and the Rise of New Powers**

European Christendom declined in power during this period. In 1453, the Ottomans, a Turkic ethnic group of Muslims, captured Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. This marked the final fall of the Roman Empire. Islam replaced Christianity as the leading religion in Constantinople, with the Hagia Sophia becoming a mosque.

The use of mercenaries and the impact of the Black Death weakened the feudal system. The labor shortage created by the plague allowed serfs to demand their freedom. Peasants rebelled against the nobility, and urban artisans sought better pay and an end to high taxes.

Even warfare changed, with people fighting for fame and career rather than ethical reasons or God's glory.

Despite the hardships, the era also saw the beginnings of the Renaissance, a rebirth of art, philosophy, and architecture. The Great Renaissance Cathedral of Florence was completed before the end of the Hundred Years War, signaling a new era for Europe.

# Introduction to the Crusades
```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGyCpI1zE6k

## The First Crusade: A Religious War Forged in Ambition and Blood

In the year 1095, Europe stood at a precipice. The Byzantine Empire, battered and bruised by ongoing territorial losses, sought assistance from the West. Emperor Alexios I, desperate to reclaim Anatolia from the encroaching Seljuq Turks, dispatched an envoy to Pope Urban II in Rome, requesting mercenary support.

Pope Urban II, ever the strategist, recognized an opportunity. Still grappling with the aftermath of the Great Schism that split the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches half a century prior, and facing internal conflicts within his own domain, he envisioned a chance to redirect attention outward. His answer came in November of 1095, delivered in a stirring sermon at Clermont, France.

According to various accounts, Urban II passionately implored his listeners, "I, or rather the Lord, beseech you as Christ's heralds to publish this everywhere and to persuade all people of whatever rank, foot soldiers, and knights, poor and rich, to carry aid promptly to those Christians… and to destroy that vile race from the lands of our friends." The "vile race" he referred to were the Muslims, who controlled Anatolia and the Holy Land. He promised "immediate remission of sins" to all who died "by the way, whether by land or by sea, or in battle against the pagans," effectively offering indulgences for participation in a holy war. "O what a disgrace," he thundered, "if such a despised and base race... which worships demons, should conquer a people which has the faith of omnipotent God and is made glorious with the name of Christ!"

The Pope's words ignited a firestorm of religious fervor across Western Europe, surpassing even his own expectations. News of his call to reclaim the Holy Land, to fight against the perceived infidel, spread like wildfire.

Before the Pope could even muster a formal army, a charismatic figure named Peter the Hermit stepped forward. In 1096, he led what became known as the People's Crusade, often regarded as the initial wave of the First Crusade. However, this movement was marred by violence and ultimately doomed. As Peter and his followers, many of whom were untrained peasants, women, and children, marched through the Rhineland, they perpetrated horrific massacres against Jewish communities, branding them as "Christ killers." This brutality foreshadowed a disturbing pattern that would plague the Crusades.

Despite their initial aim to aid the Byzantines and reclaim the Holy Land, the crusaders often inflicted chaos and destruction as they traversed foreign lands, even turning on their supposed allies. The People's Crusade met a tragic end in Anatolia, where they were decimated by the Turks.

Eventually, a more organized force, the First Crusade proper, was assembled under the auspices of the Pope. It dwarfed even Alexios' expectations, a staggering army of approximately 100,000 soldiers from Western Europe converging on the East via land and sea.

In 1099, after a long and arduous campaign, the crusaders finally captured Jerusalem from Muslim control. However, the victory came at a terrible cost. Accounts from the time describe the sieges of Antioch and Jerusalem as incredibly brutal, with large portions of the cities' populations massacred.

For much of the 12th century, the crusaders maintained control over the Holy Land. By 1135, the map of the region had undergone a significant transformation. The Byzantine Empire had reclaimed swathes of Anatolia, particularly in the west and north. More significantly, Crusader Kingdoms, also known as Crusader states, emerged as a powerful presence.

These entities, including the County of Tripoli, the Principality of Antioch, the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Edessa, were established by the Western European crusaders. Intriguingly, despite their initial pledge to aid the Byzantines, the crusaders chose to retain control of these conquered territories, establishing independent states that they would rule for the next century.

However, the tides began to turn in the mid-12th century. Muslim forces managed to recapture several important cities, setting the stage for the Second Crusade. Then, in 1187, the renowned Muslim leader Saladin recaptured Jerusalem, triggering the Third Crusade, a response that will further shape the history of the region.

```
Islamic and African Societies Insights

# 1.   The Arab Slave trade was just as big, potentially even larger, than the European slave trade,

In “The Slave Trade You've Never Heard Of | Arab Slave Trade”, the video talks about how the Arab Slave trade moved around 5 million slaves to Arabia and beyond, while in the same time the Atlantic Slave trade moved around 10 million. However, the video also says that only around 1 in 11 slaves ever survived to make it to a market, meaning the Arab slave trade was more deadly and larger in scale than the Atlantic Slave trade.

# 2.   Most of African history was never written down

In “Mansa Musa and Islam in Africa: Crash Course World History #16”, John Green talks about how much of what we know about Mansa Musa was orally past down until somebody wrote it down. If it wasn’t for archeological evidence of what Mansa Musa did, he would likely just be seen as another folk tale from West Africa. It could then be assumed, that some of the legends from the area are events that actually occurred, but we will never know as we couldn’t find evidence of their existence.  

# 3.   Everyone was being traded in the Slave Trade

In the video “The Slave Trade You've Never Heard Of | Arab Slave Trade”, there is a mention of “Ibn Butlan’s Guide to Racism”, which shows how many different ethnic groups, including North African Nubians, Slavs, Turks, and Indians, were enslaved in the Arab world. It also talks about the distinction made between certain ethnic groups, where some would be referred to as being “owned”, while others, typically Africans, would simply be “slaves”.

# 4.   Many places converted to Islam in order to stop being targeted for slavery

In “The Slave Trade You've Never Heard Of | Arab Slave Trade”, it mentions how over time, the number of slaves of “preferred ethnicities” decreased over time, which could be attributed to Islam spreading throughout the places with “preferred ethnicities”. The Turkish people of Anatolia and central Asia peacefully became Muslim, as well as some Indian and Slavic nations, and therefore making it illegal for them to be enslaved. This is opposed to Africa, where the Caliphates would open up trade routes with non-Muslim peoples, who they would purchase as slaves.

# 5.   Everyone involved knew it was wrong and still did it for the profits

In “Wonders of the African World: Slave Kingdoms”, the narrator tells a story of how an Ashanti Prince was once recorded expressing his regret for being in the slave business, but also accepting it as a part of the reality of his time period. The Ashanti Empire, the other African empires, and the European empires, all needed the slave trade to keep themselves in power

# 6.   Differences in culture perpetuated the Slave trades of this period

It can very plainly be seen that all the participants, the enslaved, the traders, and the owners, all had vastly different cultures, but the differences in cultures also helped them dehumanize each other. The European imperial powers found African cultures that had no written language, were in constant war, and practiced human sacrifice to the gods of a different religion. This difference in culture would seem to most European of the time period as if they were not even human and would lessen any moral blame they would feel in subjecting them to a life in servitude.

# 7.   The impact of the Indian ocean trade routes is often understated

The development of the East Africa, a part of Africa that currently does much better than others, owes itself to the Swahili kingdoms, which formed a trade network with itself, Arabia, and West India, that made all of them very rich. The same lasting effects of this trade route can be seen in the wealth distribution today in India, where the side of the peninsula facing Africa is much wealthier than the other parts. Modern Arabic, Swahili, Tamil, all influenced each other through this trade network, and it is even through here that the we get the Arab-Indic numeral system, which is what we all use today.

# 8.   Most written African history is biased

As was state in “Mansa Musa and Islam in Africa: Crash Course World History #16”, as well as implied in “Wonders of the African World: Slave Kingdoms”, most written African history was written after European contact. Because of this, what is written down was written from the perspective of those who were in contact with the Europeans, which would be the wealthy nobility that were currently in power. Of course, history is written by the victors, but in this case, the only history is the history of the victors. We only get the transcribed conversation with the Ashanti Prince mentioned earlier because the Ashanti Empire was in power and in relations with the Europeans. It’s hard, if not impossible, to come by any source that was not in favor of the European powers

World Civ Final Reflection

My insights into Medieval Europe deepened significantly through the provided videos and readings.  The era, marked by upheaval and transformation, reveals surprising complexities beyond the commonly held perceptions of darkness and decline.

1. **The Black Death's Impact on Feudalism (Crash Course):** While I knew the Black Death was devastating, I hadn't fully grasped its societal impact. John Green's explanation of how the massive population decline empowered serfs to demand freedom and better wages highlighted the plague's unintended consequence: the weakening of the feudal system. This shift, driven by labor shortages, underscores how even catastrophic events can be catalysts for social change.

2. **The Hundred Years War's Challenge to Chivalry (Crash Course):**  The Hundred Years War wasn't just about land; it was a crucible that tested the very ideals of medieval society. The rise of mercenaries, as described by John Green, eroded the code of chivalry, replacing knightly honor with brutal pragmatism. This shift reveals the war's transformative effect on warfare and social values.  The Extra History video further illustrated this, emphasizing how Edward III embraced chivalry initially, but the realities of protracted conflict forced a change in tactics and attitudes.

3. **The Little Ice Age's Contribution to Hardship (Crash Course):** Learning about the Little Ice Age added another layer to my understanding of the 14th and 15th centuries. The cooler temperatures and reduced harvests exacerbated existing challenges like the Black Death and the Hundred Years War, creating a perfect storm of hardship. This interconnectedness of environmental and historical factors emphasizes the complexity of understanding past societies.

4. **The Black Death's Origin and Spread (Crash Course):**  The detail about the Black Death originating in Tibet and spreading through trade routes surprised me. This realization emphasizes how interconnectedness, even in the medieval world, could have devastating consequences.  It also connects the pandemic to broader historical trends like the increasing trade and travel along the Silk Road.

5. **The Hundred Years War's Economic Dimensions (Extra History):** The Extra History video illuminated the economic drivers behind the Hundred Years War, particularly the importance of the wool trade and the Flemish alliance. This perspective helped me understand the conflict beyond simple territorial disputes, recognizing the complex interplay of political ambition and economic interests.

6. **The Crusades' Unintended Consequences (Introduction to the Crusades):** While I knew the Crusades aimed to reclaim the Holy Land, I hadn't fully considered the unintended consequences. The establishment of Crusader states, as explained in the video, demonstrated how the crusaders, despite their initial alliance with the Byzantines, ultimately pursued their own interests. This realization underscores the complex motivations and unpredictable outcomes of religious conflicts.

7. **The Protestant Reformation's Roots in the Late Medieval Period:** Though not directly addressed in the videos, the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation was laid during this period. The Great Schism, discussed in Crash Course, weakened the Church's authority and opened the door to challenges to its doctrines and practices. This connection highlights the long-term consequences of events like the Schism, setting the stage for future religious upheaval.

8. **The Witch Hunts' Connection to Social Instability:**  While not explicitly covered in the videos, the social anxieties and religious uncertainties of the late medieval period created a fertile ground for the witch hunts that would later plague Europe. The Black Death, the Hundred Years War, and the Little Ice Age all contributed to a climate of fear and suspicion, making it easier to scapegoat marginalized individuals.  This connection emphasizes the broader societal context that fueled the witch hunts.
