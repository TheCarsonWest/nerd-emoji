A **combustion reaction** is a chemical process where  a hydrocarbon) reacts rapidly with oxygen (**O₂**) to produce energy in the form of heat and light. The most common products of complete combustion are carbon dioxide (**CO₂**) and water (**H₂O**). 

#### General Form of a Combustion Reaction

The general form of a combustion reaction for a hydrocarbon can be represented as:

$$
C_xH_y + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O
$$

This equation must be balanced to account for the conservation of mass, meaning the number of atoms of each element on both sides must be equal.

#### Example: Combustion of Methane

$$
CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O
$$
#### Balancing Combustion Reactions

When balancing combustion reactions:
1. **Start with carbon (C)**: Balance the number of carbon atoms by adjusting the number of **CO₂** molecules.
2. **Next, balance hydrogen (H)**: Balance the hydrogen atoms by adjusting the number of **H₂O** molecules.
3. **Finally, balance oxygen (O)**: Adjust the number of **O₂** molecules to account for the total number of oxygen atoms on the right-hand side of the equation.

#### Example: Combustion of Propane

The balanced combustion of propane (**C₃H₈**) is:

$$
C_3H_8 + 5O_2 \rightarrow 3CO_2 + 4H_2O
$$
#### ==Complete vs. Incomplete Combustion==

- **Complete Combustion** occurs when there is an excess of oxygen. The products are typically **CO₂** and **H₂O**.
  
- **Incomplete Combustion** occurs when there is insufficient oxygen. This can produce carbon monoxide (**CO**) or even elemental carbon (**C**), along with water. An example of incomplete combustion is:

$$
2CH_4 + 3O_2 \rightarrow 2CO + 4H_2O
$$

#### Key Points to Remember:
- Combustion reactions are **exothermic**; they release energy.
- **Balancing** combustion reactions requires careful attention to the number of oxygen atoms.
- **Incomplete combustion** leads to different products, often with less energy and sometimes harmful by-products like **CO**.
