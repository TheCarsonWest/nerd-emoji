# [[Synthesis Essay]] Notes

**Goal:** To create a coherent essay that integrates information from multiple sources to support a specific claim.

**Key Components:**

* **Claim/Thesis:**  A clear, concise statement of your position on the issue.  This should be arguable and specific.  It needs to be more than just a summary of the sources.  $Thesis = Claim + Roadmap$

* **Sources:** Multiple texts (articles, excerpts, visual materials) providing different perspectives on the issue.  It's crucial to understand the nuances and potential biases within each source. [[Source Analysis Techniques]]

* **Integration:** Skillfully weaving together evidence from various sources to build a comprehensive and persuasive argument.  This isn't just summarizing; it's analyzing, comparing, and contrasting information to create new meaning.  Avoid simply listing quotes; instead, *synthesize* them to support your claims.

* **Analysis:**  Don't just present the information; analyze it.  Explain *how* the evidence supports your thesis.   Consider the rhetorical strategies used in the sources and how they contribute to their effectiveness.  [[Rhetorical Analysis]]


* **Organization:**  Logical structure is key.  Possible approaches include:
    *  Thematic organization: Group sources based on similar ideas or arguments.
    *  Source-by-source organization:  Analyze one source at a time, connecting each analysis back to your thesis.
    *  Point-by-point organization: Address specific points of the prompt in turn, drawing on evidence from multiple sources for each.


* **Counterarguments:** Acknowledge and address opposing viewpoints.  This strengthens your argument by demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the issue. [[Developing Counterarguments]]


* **Synthesis vs. Summary:**  The crucial difference: synthesis creates *new* meaning by combining multiple sources. Summary simply restates existing information.


**Common Mistakes:**

* **Simply summarizing sources:**  Lack of analysis and synthesis.
* **Poor source integration:**  Choppy transitions, lack of connection between sources and thesis.
* **Ignoring counterarguments:**  Presenting a one-sided view.
* **Unclear thesis statement:**  Lack of direction and focus.


**Example Prompt Breakdown:** (This will vary greatly, but here's a general approach)

Let's say the prompt is:  "Synthesize at least three of the provided sources to discuss the impact of social media on teenage mental health."

[[1. **Identify the core issue:**  The impact of social media on teenage mental health.
[[2]. **Analyze the sources:**  Determine the main argument/perspective of each source.  What evidence do they provide? What rhetorical strategies do they use? [[Source Analysis Techniques]]
[[3]. **Formulate a thesis:**  Develop a claim based on your analysis of the sources.  For example:  "While social media offers benefits like connection and community, its negative impacts on teenage mental health, particularly concerning anxiety and depression, outweigh the positives, as evidenced by studies on cyberbullying, unrealistic portrayals of success, and the addictive nature of the platforms."
[[4]. **Organize your essay:** Decide on the most effective organizational structure (thematic, source-by-source, or point-by-point).
[[5]. **Write your essay:**  Integrate evidence from the sources smoothly, offering analysis and explanation. Address counterarguments if relevant.
