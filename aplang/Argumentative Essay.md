# [[Argumentative Essay]] Notes

**I. Core Components:**

* **Claim/Thesis Statement:**  This is the central argument of your essay. It should be clear, concise, and debatable.  It needs to be something you can *prove* with evidence.
    *  Example:  $While\ advancements\ in\ artificial\ intelligence\ offer\ exciting\ possibilities,\ the\ ethical\ implications\ surrounding\ their\ development\ and\ deployment\ necessitate\ careful\ regulation.$
* **Evidence:** This is the factual support for your claim.  This can include statistics, examples, expert opinions, case studies, etc.  Remember to cite your sources properly! [[Evidence Evaluation & Citation]]
* **Reasoning/Analysis:** This is where you explain *how* your evidence supports your claim.  Don't just present the evidence; explain its significance and connect it directly back to your thesis.
* **Counterarguments:** Acknowledging and addressing opposing viewpoints strengthens your argument. This shows you've considered other perspectives and strengthens your credibility. [[Counterargument Strategies]]
* **Refutation:** This is where you directly challenge the validity of opposing arguments.  Provide reasons why your position is stronger.
* **Conclusion:** This summarizes your main points and restates your thesis in a new way.  It should leave the reader with a clear understanding of your position and its implications.
