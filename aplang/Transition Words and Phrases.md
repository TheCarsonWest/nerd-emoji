**Mathematical Representation of Transition Types (Conceptual):**

Let's represent the transition types as sets:  $A = \{\text{Addition}\}$, $C = \{\text{Contrast}\}$, $E = \{\text{Examples}\}$, etc.

A complex sentence could then be represented as a combination of these sets.  For example, a sentence with both addition and contrast could be denoted as $A \cup C$.  The number of elements in the set would represent the number of transition words/phrases used within a sentence or paragraph.  This is a simplistic representation, and doesn't account for the nuances of language.  Further analysis would require more sophisticated linguistic modeling.

## $$ \text{Sentence Complexity} \propto |\bigcup_{i} S_i| $$

Where $S_i$ represents the set of transition types used in a sentence, and $|\bigcup_{i} S_i|$ represents the cardinality (number of elements) of the union of all transition type sets.  This equation suggests that sentence complexity increases with the number of different transition types used.
