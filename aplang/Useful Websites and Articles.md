This note serves as a central hub for websites and articles I find useful.  I will categorize them for easier access.

**Category: Programming**

* **Website:** Stack Overflow  ([Stack Overflow Usage Notes])
    * Excellent for quick answers to programming questions.  Use the search function effectively!
* **Website:** MDN Web Docs (Mozilla Developer Network)
    * Comprehensive documentation for web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).  Great for learning and reference. ([MDN Web Docs Notes])
* **Article:** "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin ([[Clean Code Summary]])
    *  Key concepts on writing readable and maintainable code.


**Category: Mathematics**

* **Website:** Wolfram Alpha
    * Powerful computational engine. Useful for symbolic calculations, data analysis, and more. ([Wolfram Alpha Usage Notes])
* **Article:** Khan Academy's Linear Algebra Course ([[Khan Academy Linear Algebra Notes]])
    * Excellent free resource for learning linear algebra.


**Category:  Data Science**

* **Website:** Towards Data Science (Medium Publication)
    *  A wealth of articles on various data science topics.  Use keywords to search for specific areas. ([Towards Data Science Notes])
* **Article:**  "Introduction to Statistical Learning" ([[ISL Book Notes]])
    * A classic textbook (freely available online) for learning statistical learning methods.


**Category: Project Management**

* **Website:** Trello
    *  Useful for Kanban-style project management. ([Trello Workflow Notes])


**Equations:**

The area of a circle with radius $r$ is given by $A = \pi r^[[2]]$.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, $a^[[2]] + b^[[2]] = c^[[2]]$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.


## $$E = mc^[[2]]$$


This equation represents Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence.


**Note:**  I will create separate notes for each of the bracketed items above as needed.  This will allow for more detailed information and prevent this note from becoming too cluttered.
