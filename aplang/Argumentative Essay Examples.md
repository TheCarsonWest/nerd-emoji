# [[Argumentative Essay]] Examples]]

**Goal:**  Compile examples and analyze their structure, strengths, and weaknesses.  This will inform my own essay writing.

**Types of Arguments to Explore:**

* **Classical Argument:**  Thesis statement, background, lines of argumentation (with evidence and refutation of counterarguments), conclusion.  [[Classical Argument Structure]]
* **Rogerian Argument:** Finding common ground, acknowledging opposing viewpoints, then presenting your own perspective as a reasonable compromise. [[Rogerian Argument Examples]]
* **Toulmin Argument:**  Claim, data, warrant, backing, qualifier, rebuttal.  [[Toulmin Model]] Deep Dive]]

**Examples to Analyze:**

* **Example [[1]]:  The ethics of artificial intelligence.**  Focus on specific ethical dilemmas (job displacement, algorithmic bias) and their societal impact.  Need to find strong sources on this. [[AI Ethics Sources]]
* **Example [[2]]: The effectiveness of different learning styles.**  Compare and contrast visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning; analyze research studies supporting/refuting their relative effectiveness.  [[Learning Styles Research]]
* **Example [[3]]:  The impact of social media on mental health.** This requires a nuanced approach, acknowledging both positive and negative aspects.  Correlations vs. Causation must be carefully addressed. [[Social Media & Mental Health - Data]]


**Elements to Analyze in Each Example:**

* **Thesis Statement:** Is it clear, concise, and arguable?  Is it directly supported by the essay's content?
* **Evidence:**  Is the evidence relevant, credible, and sufficient to support the claims? What types of evidence are used (statistical data, expert opinions, anecdotal evidence)?  [[Evidence Evaluation Checklist]]
* **Counterarguments:** Are opposing viewpoints acknowledged and addressed effectively? Is the refutation logical and persuasive?
* **Structure and Organization:** Is the essay logically organized?  Are transitions smooth and clear?
* **Style and Tone:** Is the writing style clear, concise, and engaging? Is the tone appropriate for the audience and purpose?  [[Essay Style Guide]]
* **Logical Fallacies:** Are there any logical fallacies present (e.g., straw man, ad hominem, appeal to emotion)? [[Logical Fallacies Reference]]


**Equations (Illustrative â€“  May be irrelevant to examples but useful generally):**

The relationship between $x$ and $y$ can be modeled using a linear equation: $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.

## $$ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx $$ ##

This represents the definite integral of a function $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$.  This is relevant if we are analyzing quantitative data in an essay example.


**Future Tasks:**

* Find and read at least [[3]] strong argumentative essays from reputable sources.
* Create detailed analyses of each essay using the elements listed above.
* Write my own argumentative essay based on this analysis.
