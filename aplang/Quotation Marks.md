# [[Grammar and Mechanics]]
# [[Quotation Marks]]

**Purpose:** To indicate direct speech, titles of works, or special emphasis.

**Types:**

* **Double quotes ("..."):**  Most common in American English.  Used for direct quotations.  $Example: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." $
* **Single quotes ('...'):** Commonly used in British English, and often for quotations *within* quotations. $Example:  He said, 'She replied, "I understand."'$.  In American English, often used to denote titles of articles or chapters within a larger work.
    * [[Nested Quotations]]
* **Guillemets («...»):** Used in many European languages.  Often used for direct quotations.  They are visually distinct from double quotes.  $Example: «Le renard brun saute par-dessus le chien paresseux.»$

**Rules:**

* **Periods and commas:** Always placed *inside* the closing quotation mark. $Example: "This is a sentence."$.
* **Colons and semicolons:** Always placed *outside* the closing quotation mark. $Example: "This is a sentence"; however, it's not the only one. $
* **Question marks and exclamation points:** Placed *inside* the closing quotation mark if they are part of the quote, and *outside* if they apply to the entire sentence.
    * Inside: $Example: "Did you see that?"$
    * Outside: $Example: Did he say, "I'm leaving"?$

**Special Cases:**

* **Quotations within quotations:** Use alternating single and double quotes. See [[Nested Quotations]].
* **Titles:**  Use quotation marks for shorter works (articles, poems, songs), and italics for longer works (books, movies, albums). [[Title Formatting]]
* **Irony or sarcasm:** Quotation marks can sometimes be used to signal irony, but this usage should be employed sparingly to avoid ambiguity. [[Irony and Sarcasm in Writing]]
