# [[Rhetorical Analysis]] Techniques]]

These notes outline key techniques for analyzing rhetoric.  Remember to consider the *context* of the text always!

**I.  Identifying the Rhetorical Situation:**

* **Audience:**  Who is the intended audience? How does the speaker/writer tailor their message to this audience?  Consider demographics, values, beliefs, and pre-existing knowledge. [[Audience Analysis]]
* **Purpose:** What is the speaker/writer trying to achieve?  To persuade? Inform? Entertain?  What is their desired outcome? [[Purpose & Intent]]
* **Exigence:** What is the urgency or problem that prompted this communication? What event or circumstance necessitated this rhetoric?

**II. Analyzing Rhetorical Appeals:**

* **Ethos (Ethical Appeal):**  How does the speaker/writer establish credibility and trustworthiness? Consider their expertise, authority, and moral character.  Are they using testimonials or citing credible sources? [[Ethos & Credibility]]
* **Pathos (Emotional Appeal):** How does the speaker/writer evoke emotion in the audience?  Identify the specific emotions targeted (e.g., fear, anger, joy, hope) and the techniques used (e.g., vivid language, storytelling, imagery). [[Pathos & Emotion]]
* **Logos (Logical Appeal):** How does the speaker/writer use reason and logic to support their claims?  Look for evidence, statistics, facts, and logical reasoning (deductive, inductive).  Are there any fallacies present?  [[Logos & Logic]], [[Logical Fallacies]]

**III. Analyzing [[Rhetorical Devices]]:**

* **Figurative [[Language]]:** Metaphors, similes, analogies, personification, hyperbole, etc.  What effect do these create? How do they enhance the message? [[Figurative [[Language]] Analysis]]
* **Sentence Structure:** Consider the length and complexity of sentences.  Short, declarative sentences can create a sense of urgency, while long, complex sentences can convey detail and sophistication.  [[Sentence Structure & Effect]]
* **Repetition:**  The repetition of words, phrases, or sounds.  What is the effect of this repetition? Does it emphasize a point, create rhythm, or evoke emotion?
* **Tone:** What is the overall attitude or feeling conveyed by the speaker/writer?  Is it formal, informal, serious, humorous, sarcastic, etc.? [[Identifying Tone]]
* **Diction:** Word choice.  Consider the connotations of words and their impact on the audience. [[Diction & Connotation]]

**IV.  Analyzing the Text's Structure and Organization:**

* **Introduction:** How does the text begin?  Does it grab the audience's attention?  What is the thesis statement or main idea?
* **Body:** How are the main points organized and developed?  What evidence is used to support each point?
* **Conclusion:** How does the text end?  Does it summarize the main points?  Does it leave the audience with a call to action?

**V.  Putting it All Together:**

After analyzing the individual elements, consider how they work together to create the overall effect of the text.  How do the appeals, devices, and structure contribute to the speaker/writer's purpose and effectiveness?  Write a concise and insightful analysis that demonstrates your understanding of the rhetorical strategies used.

**Equations (Example):**

An example of a simple linear equation: $y = mx + b$

A more complex equation showing the quadratic formula:  $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^[[2]] - 4ac}}{2a}$$
