**Goal:** Develop efficient and effective note-taking methods for optimal learning and retention.

**Methods:**

* **Cornell Notes:**
    * Divide paper into three sections: main notes, cues, and summary.
    * [[Cornell Notes Detailed Explanation]]  
    * Best for: lectures, readings with clear structure.

* **Mind Mapping:**
    * Central idea branches into related subtopics and details.  
    * Visual representation aids in understanding connections.
    * Best for: brainstorming, complex topics, generating ideas.
    * [[Mind Mapping Techniques]]

* **Sketchnoting:**
    * Combines drawings, symbols, and keywords to create visual notes.
    * Improves engagement and memory.
    * Best for: lectures, meetings, creative brainstorming.
    * [[Sketchnoting Examples and Tips]]

* **Linear Note Taking:**
    * Traditional method of writing down information in a linear fashion.
    * Simple, but can become less effective with complex topics.
    * Best for: straightforward lectures or readings.

**Equation for Note Taking Efficiency:**

$Efficiency = \frac{Information Retained}{Time Spent}$

This equation highlights the importance of optimizing both information retention and time management.  We want to maximize the numerator (information retained) and minimize the denominator (time spent).

**Factors Affecting Efficiency:**

* **Active listening/reading:** [[Active Learning Strategies]]
* **Note organization and structure:** [[Note Organization Methods]]
* **Review and revision:** Regular review is crucial for long-term retention. $Retention \propto Frequency \; of \; Review$  (Retention is proportional to the frequency of review)

**Tools:**

* Pen and paper (classic and reliable)
* Note-taking apps (Evernote, OneNote, Google Keep)  [[Digital Note-Taking Apps Comparison]]


## $$Retention = f(Understanding, Engagement, Review)$$

This equation suggests that retention is a function of understanding the material, engagement during the note-taking process, and the frequency of review.


**Further Research:**

*  The impact of different note-taking methods on learning outcomes.
*  The role of technology in enhancing note-taking.
*  Effective strategies for reviewing notes.
