This note covers the principles of logos and logic in argumentation.

**I. Logos:**

Logos refers to the appeal to reason and logic in an argument.  It's about using evidence, facts, and logical reasoning to persuade the audience.  A strong logos-based argument is built on:

* **Sound Premises:**  The starting points of your argument must be true or highly probable. $P \implies Q$
* **Valid Reasoning:** The connection between premises and conclusion must be logically sound.  For example, using deductive reasoning, if the premises are true, the conclusion *must* be true. [[Deductive Reasoning]]
* **Strong Evidence:** Supporting claims with credible evidence, such as statistics, research findings, expert opinions, and examples. [[Types of Evidence]]

**II. Logic:**

Logic is the study of valid reasoning.  It provides frameworks and tools to analyze arguments and determine their soundness. Key concepts include:

* **Propositions:** Statements that can be either true or false.  $P$, $Q$, etc.
* **Connectives:** Symbols that link propositions, such as:
    * $\land$ (and) - conjunction
    * $\lor$ (or) - disjunction
    * $\implies$ (implies) - conditional
    * $\iff$ (if and only if) - biconditional
    * $\neg$ (not) - negation
* **Truth Tables:** Used to determine the truth value of compound propositions based on the truth values of their component propositions. [[Truth Tables]]
* **Arguments:** A set of propositions, where one (the conclusion) is claimed to follow from the others (the premises). [[Argument Structure]]
* **Fallacies:** Errors in reasoning that make an argument invalid or unsound. [[Logical Fallacies]]

**III. Relationship between Logos and Logic:**

Logos relies heavily on logic.  To construct a strong, persuasive argument based on logos, you must use sound logic.  A lack of logical rigor weakens the persuasive power of the argument, even if the premises are factually correct.  For example:

Premise [[1]]: All men are mortal.
Premise [[2]]: Socrates is a man.
Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

This is a valid deductive argument, a strong example of logos.

**IV.  Further Exploration:**

* [[Inductive Reasoning]]
* [[Abductive Reasoning]]
* [[Formal Logic]]
* [[Informal Logic]]


**Example:**

Let's consider the argument: "The Earth is warming because of increased greenhouse gas emissions.  Scientific studies show a strong correlation between greenhouse gas levels and global temperatures."  This argument uses logos effectively by:

* Presenting a clear conclusion (Earth is warming).
* Offering a cause (increased greenhouse gas emissions).
* Providing evidence (scientific studies showing correlation).

However, the strength of the argument depends on the quality of the scientific studies cited.  A weak or biased study would undermine the logos of the argument.
