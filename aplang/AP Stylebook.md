# [[Grammar and Mechanics]]
# [[AP Stylebook]] Notes

**Key Sections & Concepts:**

* **Capitalization:**  Generally conservative.  Proper nouns are capitalized; common nouns are not.  Specific examples needed (see [[Capitalization Rules]]).

* **Numbers:** Spell out numbers zero through nine; use figures for 10 and above.  Exceptions exist for ages, addresses, etc. (see [[Number Usage Rules]]).

* **Dates & Times:**  Follow specific AP style for date and time formatting.  (e.g.,  Month Day, Year; [[3]] p.m., not [[3]] PM) (see [[Date and Time Formatting]]).

* **Abbreviations:** Use sparingly.  Spell out on first reference, then abbreviate if appropriate.  (See [[Abbreviations and Acronyms]]).


* **Punctuation:**
    * **[[Commas]]:**  Use the serial comma (Oxford comma).  $x_1, x_2, and x_3$.
    * **Semicolons:** Use to join closely related independent clauses.
    * **Colons:** Use to introduce a list or explanation.


* **State Names:** Spell out state names in body text, except when used with a city name (e.g.,  "He lives in Springfield, [[Illinois]]," but  "He moved to Ill."). See [[State Name Abbreviations]].

* **Titles:** Capitalize titles before names, but not afterward. (e.g., President Biden, but the president). More detail in [[Titles and Names]].


* **Quotes:** Use quotation marks for direct quotes.  Single quotes for quotes within quotes.  Attribution should follow the quote. Example: "This is a quote," he said.


* **Attribution:**  Usually uses said, avoid more descriptive verbs (see [[Attribution and Verbs]]).


* **Active vs. Passive Voice:** Prefer active voice.  Active voice is clearer and more direct.

* **Accuracy & Fairness:** Verify facts. Be fair and objective in reporting.

* **Bias-Free [[Language]]:** Avoid stereotypes and biased language.


**Equations (Examples):**

Inline equation: The area of a circle is given by $A = \pi r^[[2]]$.

Block equation:
$$ E = mc^[[2]] $$
