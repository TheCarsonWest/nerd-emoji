**I. Understanding the Prompt:**

* **Deconstructing the Prompt:** Identify keywords, the specific task (e.g., analyze, compare, evaluate), and the scope of the argument.  Look for implied biases or perspectives. [[Prompt Analysis Techniques]]

* **Identifying the Argumentative Focus:** What is the central issue or question the essay needs to address?  This will guide your selection and organization of evidence.

**II. Selecting and Organizing Evidence:**

* **Source Analysis:** For each source, summarize the main argument and identify key supporting evidence.  Note areas of agreement and disagreement between sources. [[Source Evaluation Criteria]]

* **Grouping Sources:** Categorize sources based on their perspectives or arguments. This will help structure your essay and build a cohesive argument. Consider creating a table to organize information.  Example:

| Source | Main Argument | Supporting Evidence | Perspective |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source A | ... | ... | ... |
| Source B | ... | ... | ... |
| Source C | ... | ... | ... |


* **Developing a Thesis Statement:**  Your thesis should clearly state your position on the central issue and briefly preview the main points you will support with evidence.  The thesis should directly address the prompt and go beyond simply summarizing the sources. [[Thesis Statement Construction]]


**III. Writing the Essay:**

* **Introduction:** Briefly introduce the topic and provide necessary background information. State your thesis clearly and concisely.

* **Body Paragraphs:** Each body paragraph should focus on a specific aspect of your argument, supported by evidence from multiple sources.  Use signal phrases to introduce quotes and paraphrases.  Analyze the evidence and explain how it supports your thesis.  Consider using a method like compare/contrast or argumentation. [[Argumentation Strategies]] [[Comparative Analysis]]

* **Synthesis:**  Don't just summarize sources; synthesize them. Show how they relate to each other and build your argument.  Identify points of agreement, disagreement, and nuance.  $synthesis = \sum_{i=[[1]]}^{n} weight_i \times source_i$ (where $weight_i$ represents the importance of each source and $source_i$ represents the information from each source).  This is a simplified representation; actual synthesis is more nuanced.


* **Conclusion:** Restate your thesis in a new way and summarize your main points. Offer final thoughts or implications of your argument.  Avoid introducing new evidence.


**IV.  Revision and Editing:**

* **Clarity and Coherence:** Ensure your argument is clear, logical, and easy to follow.  Check for smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas.

* **[[Grammar and Mechanics]]:** Proofread carefully for errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.

* **MLA/APA Formatting:** Follow the appropriate citation style consistently throughout the essay. [[Citation Formatting]]


**V.  Practice & Feedback:**

* Practice writing synthesis essays using different prompts and sources.  Seek feedback from peers and instructors to improve your writing skills. [[Practice Prompts]]
