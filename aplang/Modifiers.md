# [[Modifiers]]

**Definition:** [[Modifiers]] are words, phrases, or clauses that add detail or further explanation to another word or phrase in a sentence.  They describe, limit, or qualify the meaning of the element they modify.

**Types of [[Modifiers]]:**

* **Adjectives:** Modify nouns and pronouns.  Example: *the *big* dog*  (big modifies dog)
* **Adverbs:** Modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. Example: *He ran *quickly*. *(quickly modifies ran)*
* **Participial Phrases:** Verb forms ending in -ing or -ed that act as adjectives. Example: *The *running* water* (*running* modifies water)
* **Prepositional Phrases:** Phrases beginning with a preposition that modify nouns, verbs, or adjectives. Example: *The book *on the table*** (*on the table* modifies book)
* **Relative Clauses:** Clauses beginning with relative pronouns (who, whom, whose, which, that) that modify nouns or pronouns. Example: *The car, *which is red*, is mine.* (*which is red* modifies car)
* **Infinitive Phrases:** Phrases beginning with "to" + verb that can function as adjectives, adverbs, or nouns. Example: *I have a desire *to travel*.* (*to travel* modifies desire)

**Placement of [[Modifiers]]:**

Misplaced or dangling modifiers can lead to unclear or humorous sentences.  Generally, modifiers should be placed as close as possible to the word or phrase they modify.

**Examples of Misplaced [[Modifiers]]:**

* Incorrect:  *I saw a dog running down the street with a long tail.* (Does the street have a long tail?)
* Correct:  *I saw a dog with a long tail running down the street.*
