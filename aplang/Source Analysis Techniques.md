**Goal:** Develop a systematic approach to critically evaluating sources for research and writing.


**I.  Source Types & Credibility**

*   **Primary Sources:**  Direct evidence from the time period being studied (e.g., diaries, letters, artifacts).  Credibility hinges on authenticity and authorial bias. [[Primary Source Evaluation]]
*   **Secondary Sources:** Analyses and interpretations of primary sources (e.g., books, articles, documentaries). Credibility depends on author expertise, methodology, and potential biases. [[Secondary Source Evaluation]]
*   **Tertiary Sources:** Summaries and compilations of primary and secondary sources (e.g., encyclopedias, textbooks).  Generally less credible for in-depth research but useful for background information.


**II.  Evaluating [[Source Credibility]]**

*   **Authorship:** Who created the source? What are their credentials and potential biases?  Consider their expertise, affiliation, and potential conflicts of interest.
*   **Accuracy:** Is the information factual and verifiable? Check for inconsistencies, errors, and unsupported claims.  Compare information with other sources.
*   **Objectivity:** Is the source presenting information fairly and without bias? Look for evidence of slanted language, emotional appeals, or one-sided perspectives.
*   **Currency:** How recent is the source? Is the information still relevant and up-to-date? Consider the field of study and the rate of change in knowledge.
*   **Purpose:** What is the intended purpose of the source? To inform, persuade, entertain, or something else?  Understanding the purpose can help identify potential biases.


**III.  Analyzing Source Content**

*   **Identifying Main Ideas:** Summarize the key arguments and findings.
*   **Interpreting Evidence:** Evaluate the quality and relevance of evidence presented.  Are the conclusions supported by the evidence?
*   **Identifying Biases:**  Recognize potential biases in the selection, presentation, and interpretation of information.  [[Bias Detection Techniques]]
*   **Contextualization:** Consider the historical, social, and cultural context in which the source was created. This can help interpret meaning and identify biases.


**IV.  Citation & Documentation**

*   Properly cite all sources to avoid plagiarism.  Use a consistent citation style (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago). [[Citation Management]]


**V.  Quantitative Analysis (Applicable to some sources)**

*   If dealing with numerical data, analyze for statistical significance, potential outliers, and data biases.  $p < 0.05$ indicates statistical significance.  [[Statistical Significance Testing]]
*   Consider data visualization techniques to better understand trends and patterns. [[Data Visualization Techniques]]



**VI.  Qualitative Analysis (Applicable to some sources)**

*   For textual sources, perform a thematic analysis to identify recurring themes and patterns.  [[Thematic Analysis]]
*   Use content analysis to quantify the presence of specific words, phrases, or concepts.  [[Content Analysis]]


**VII.  Cross-Referencing & Triangulation**

*   Compare information across multiple sources to verify accuracy and identify inconsistencies.  This process of triangulation increases the reliability of your conclusions.
