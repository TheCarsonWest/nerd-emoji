# [[Source Analysis Techniques]]
# [[Secondary Source Evaluation]]

**Goal:** To develop a systematic approach for critically evaluating secondary sources used in research.

**Key Criteria:**

* **Authority:**
    * Author's credentials: $expertise = f(education, experience, publications)$
    * Publisher reputation: [[Publisher Reputation]]
    * Publication date:  How recent is the information?  Is it still relevant given the field's advancements?  Consider the half-life of knowledge in the specific field.
* **Accuracy:**
    * Evidence of factual accuracy:  Are claims supported by evidence?  Are sources cited appropriately?  Are there any inconsistencies or contradictions?
    * Methodology (if applicable):  Is the methodology clearly explained and appropriate to the research question?  [[Research Methodologies]]
    * Corroboration: Does the information align with other credible sources? [[Cross-referencing Sources]]
* **Objectivity:**
    * Bias detection:  Is there evidence of bias (political, ideological, personal)?  What is the author's perspective?
    * Tone and language:  Is the language neutral and objective, or is it emotional or persuasive?
    * Funding sources:  Were there any potential conflicts of interest due to funding sources? [[Funding and Conflict of Interest]]
* **Currency:**
    * Publication date: As mentioned above, how recent is the source?
    * Timeliness of information: Is the information still current and relevant in the context of the research?
* **Coverage:**
    * Scope and depth: Does the source adequately cover the topic?  Is the level of detail appropriate for the research?
    * Perspective: Does the source offer a balanced and comprehensive perspective, or does it focus on a narrow viewpoint?

**Process:**

[[1. **Identify source characteristics:** Author, publisher, publication date.
2. **Assess authority and credibility:** Check credentials and publisher reputation.
3. **Evaluate accuracy:** Look for evidence and citations; check for inconsistencies.
4. **Analyze objectivity:** Identify potential biases and conflicts of interest.
5. **Determine currency:** Assess the timeliness of the information.
6. **Consider coverage:** Evaluate the scope and depth of the information.

**Example Questions:**

* What are the author's credentials?
* What is the publisher's reputation?
* When was the source published?
* Is the information supported by evidence?
* Are there any potential biases?
* Is the information current and relevant?
* Does the source provide a balanced perspective?


**Tools & Resources:**

* Citation databases (e.g., Web of Science, Scopus)
* Fact-checking websites (e.g., Snopes, PolitiFact)
* Library resources and subject librarians
