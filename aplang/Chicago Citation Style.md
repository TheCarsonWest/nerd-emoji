# [[Evidence Evaluation & Citation]]
# [[Chicago Citation Style]] Notes

**Key Differences from other styles:**  Chicago has two main citation systems:  Notes and Bibliography and Author-Date.  This document focuses on Notes and Bibliography.

* **Notes:**  Citations appear as numbered footnotes or endnotes.  Each note provides a complete citation for a source.
* **Bibliography:** A complete list of all sources cited is included at the end of the paper.  This is *separate* from the notes.


**Basic Note Format (Footnote/Endnote):**

1.  For books: Author's Last Name, *Title of Work*, (City of Publication: Publisher, Year), Page Number.  
    *Example:* Smith, John, *A History of Cats*, ([[New York]]: Meow Press, 2023), 12.


2. For journal articles: Author's Last Name, "Article Title," *Journal Title* Volume Number, No. Issue Number (Year): Pages.
    *Example:* Jones, Mary, "The Psychology of Purring," *Feline Studies* 15, no. 2 (2022): 55-78.


3.  For websites: Author's Name (if available), "Title of Page," Website Name, URL, Accessed Date.
    *Example:*  "Cats and Dogs," American Kennel Club, [https://www.akc.org/](https://www.akc.org/), accessed October 26, 2023.


**Bibliography Format:**  The bibliography lists all cited works alphabetically by author's last name.  Format largely mirrors the note format but without page numbers.

* **Book Example:** Smith, John. *A History of Cats*. [[New York]]: Meow Press, 2023.
* **Journal Article Example:** Jones, Mary. "The Psychology of Purring." *Feline Studies* 15, no. 2 (2022): 55-78.
* **Website Example:** "Cats and Dogs." American Kennel Club.  [https://www.akc.org/](https://www.akc.org/). Accessed October 26, 2023.


**Specific Cases:**

* **Multiple Authors:** List all authors in the order they appear in the source. Use "and" between the last two authors.
* **Editors:** Use "ed." or "eds." after the editor's name(s) if applicable.
* **Translations:** Include translator's name after the title.  e.g.,  *Title*. Translated by Jane Doe.


**Subsequent Citations:**

After the first citation of a source, use shortened forms in subsequent notes (e.g.,  Smith, *Cats*, 25; Smith, *Cats*, 30).

**Equations (Example):**

The Pythagorean theorem is represented as: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.


**More complex equations:**

$$ \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} $$
