# [[Prompt Analysis Techniques]]

These notes detail various techniques for analyzing prompts, particularly for large language models (LLMs).  The goal is to understand the nuances of a prompt to better control the LLM's output.

**I. Identifying Prompt Components:**

A prompt can be broken down into several key components:

* **Instruction:** The core task or request.  Example: "Write a short story."
* **Context:** Background information or constraints. Example: "about a talking dog who solves mysteries."
* **Input Data:** Specific data provided to inform the response. Example: "The dog's name is Sherlock Bones."
* **Output Specifications:** Desired format or style of the response. Example: "in the style of Agatha Christie."

**II. Analyzing Implicit Information:**

Often, a prompt contains implicit information that requires inference:

* **Audience:** Who is the intended recipient of the response?  This impacts tone and style.
* **Purpose:** What is the goal of the prompt?  Is it to inform, persuade, entertain, etc.?
* **Assumptions:** What underlying assumptions are made by the prompt?  Are there any biases?


**III. Techniques for Prompt Decomposition:**

Several techniques aid in breaking down complex prompts:

* **Keyword Extraction:** Identifying the most important terms.
* **Semantic Parsing:** Understanding the meaning and relationships between keywords. [[Semantic Parsing Techniques]]
* **Dependency Parsing:** Analyzing the grammatical structure of the prompt. [[Dependency Parsing Explained]]


**IV.  Prompt Engineering Strategies (Related Notes):**

* **Few-Shot Learning:** Providing examples in the prompt to guide the LLM. [[Few-Shot Prompt Engineering]]
* **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Guiding the LLM through a step-by-step reasoning process. [[Chain-of-Thought Prompting Techniques]]
* **Zero-Shot Prompting:**  Prompting the LLM without any examples. [[Zero-Shot Prompting Strategies]]


**V. Evaluating Prompt Effectiveness:**

Measuring how well a prompt elicits the desired response:

* **Qualitative Evaluation:** Human judgment of the response quality.
* **Quantitative Evaluation:** Using metrics like BLEU score or ROUGE score (for text generation tasks).  [[Evaluation Metrics for LLMs]]


**VI. Equations for Prompt Analysis (Illustrative):**

Let's assume a simplified model where prompt effectiveness ($E$) is a function of instruction clarity ($I$), context relevance ($C$), and output specification precision ($P$).

An overly simplistic model could be represented as:

$E = w_I I + w_C C + w_P P$

where $w_I$, $w_C$, and $w_P$ are weights representing the relative importance of each component.  A more sophisticated model would be needed to capture the complexities of prompt interpretation.

## $$E = f(I, C, P, A)$$

Where:

* $E$ = Effectiveness
* $I$ = Instruction Clarity
* $C$ = Context Relevance
* $P$ = Output Specification Precision
* $A$ = Ambiguity (Lower is better)

This equation highlights the need for more complex modeling to capture the interdependencies between variables.  Future work will focus on developing more robust models.
