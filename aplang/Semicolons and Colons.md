# [[Grammar and Mechanics]]
# [[Semicolons and Colons]]

These notes cover the usage of semicolons and colons in writing.

**Semicolons (;)**

* **Join independent clauses:**  Use a semicolon to connect two closely related independent clauses that could stand alone as separate sentences.  Avoid using a comma in this case.
    * Example: The rain poured down; the streets flooded quickly.

* **With conjunctive adverbs:** Use a semicolon before a conjunctive adverb (e.g., however, therefore, moreover, consequently) that connects two independent clauses.  A comma follows the conjunctive adverb.
    * Example:  The game was delayed; however, the fans remained enthusiastic.

* **Complex [[Lists]]:** Semicolons can improve clarity in lists where items already contain commas.
    * Example:  I've visited London, England; Paris, [[France]]; and Rome, Italy.


**Colons (:)**

* **Introduce lists or explanations:** Use a colon to introduce a list, an explanation, or an example that follows an independent clause.  The clause before the colon must be a complete sentence.
    * Example: I need three things from the store: milk, eggs, and bread.
    * Example: The reason for the delay was clear: the equipment malfunctioned.

* **Introduce quotations:** Colons can be used to formally introduce a quotation, although a comma is also acceptable.
    * Example: The professor stated: "The exam will be difficult."

* **Between numbers (time, ratios, etc.):** Colons are used to separate numbers in certain contexts.
    * Example:  The race starts at [[2]:00 PM.
    * Example: The ratio of boys to girls was [[3]:[[2].


**Distinguishing between [[Semicolons and Colons]]:**

The key difference lies in what follows the punctuation mark.  A semicolon joins two independent clauses. A colon introduces something that explains or expands on the preceding clause (list, explanation, quotation, etc.).
