# [[Synthesis Essay Strategies]]
# [[Practice Prompts]]

These notes are for brainstorming and organizing practice prompts.

**Categorization:**  We need a system for categorizing prompts to facilitate targeted practice.  Possible categories include:

* **By Skill:** [[Skill-Based Prompt Categorization]]  (This will be a separate note detailing how to categorize prompts based on specific skills being tested, like grammar, vocabulary, argumentation, etc.)
* **By Format:**  (e.g., essay, short answer, multiple choice, creative writing)
* **By Topic:** (e.g., history, science, current events, literature)
* **By Difficulty:** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)


**Prompt Generation Techniques:**

* **Keyword Prompts:** Start with a core keyword and branch out into related ideas.  Example: *keyword:  justice*  leads to prompts about social justice, criminal justice, restorative justice, etc.
* **"What if...?" Scenarios:**  Posing hypothetical situations can create engaging and thought-provoking prompts.  Example: *"What if humans discovered a new habitable planet?"*
* **Problem-Solving Prompts:** Present a problem or challenge that requires critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Example: *"A local community is facing a water shortage.  Propose solutions and analyze their feasibility."*
* **[[Comparative Analysis]] Prompts:**  Ask students to compare and contrast different ideas, concepts, or historical periods. Example: *"Compare and contrast the French and American Revolutions."*

**Examples of Prompts:**

* **Essay:**  Discuss the impact of social media on political discourse.
* **Short Answer:** Explain the significance of the $E=mc^[[2]]$ equation.
* **Multiple Choice:** Which of the following is a primary source for studying the American [[Civil War]]?
    * a) A textbook on the [[Civil War]]
    * b) A letter written by a soldier during the [[Civil War]]
    * c) A documentary about the [[Civil War]]
    * d) A history article analyzing the [[Civil War]]

**Evaluation Criteria:** [[Prompt Evaluation Metrics]] (A separate note to define criteria for evaluating the quality and effectiveness of prompts)


**Prompt Templates:**

We should create templates to make prompt generation more efficient. For example:

* **Compare/Contrast Template:**  Compare and contrast [Concept A] and [Concept B] in terms of [Aspect [[1]]], [Aspect [[2]]], and [Aspect [[3]]].
* **Problem-Solving Template:**  The community of [Location] is facing the challenge of [Problem].  Propose three solutions and analyze their potential benefits and drawbacks.

**Future Considerations:**

* Integrating AI for prompt generation. [[AI-Assisted Prompt Generation]]
* Database for storing and managing prompts. [[Prompt Database Design]]
