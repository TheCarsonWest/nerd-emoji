# [[Thesis Statement Development]]

**Definition:** A thesis statement is a concise summary of the main point or claim of an essay, research paper, or other written work.  It typically appears at the end of the introductory paragraph and provides a roadmap for the reader, outlining the key arguments that will be developed in the body paragraphs.

**Characteristics of a Strong Thesis Statement:**

* **Clear and concise:** Avoid ambiguity and wordiness.  It should be easily understood.
* **Specific and focused:**  It should not be too broad or general.  It should address a specific aspect of the topic.
* **Arguable:** It should present a claim that can be supported with evidence and analysis.  It's not just a statement of fact.
* **Significant:** It should be worth exploring and offer a new perspective or insight.
* **Actionable:** It should guide the development of the entire paper, providing a framework for the body paragraphs.


**Formulating a Thesis Statement:**

[[1. **Brainstorming:** [[Brainstorming Techniques]]
[[2]. **Identifying the main argument:** What is the central point you want to make?
[[3]. **Developing a working thesis:** Start with a preliminary statement and refine it as you research and write.
[[4]. **Refining the thesis:** Ensure clarity, focus, and arguability. Consider using the "because" method to state your claim and your reason for supporting it:  *Claim* because *reason*.  For example: "Shakespeare's Hamlet is a tragedy because of the protagonist's indecisiveness and the overwhelming forces of fate."
[[5]. **Testing the thesis:** Does it address the prompt? Can it be supported with evidence?  Will it guide the development of your paper?


**Types of Thesis Statements:**

* **Argumentative:** Presents a claim that requires supporting evidence and refutation of counterarguments.
* **Analytical:** Breaks down a complex topic into its components to analyze and interpret it.
* **Expository:** Explains or informs the reader about a topic without taking a stance.


**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

* **Too broad:**  "Pollution is bad."  (Needs to be narrowed down to a specific type of pollution and its effects.)
* **Too narrow:**  "My neighbor's cat sheds a lot." (Not suitable for a larger paper.)
* **Unarguable:**  "The sky is blue." (Statement of fact, not an argument.)
* **Unsupported claims:**  Assertions that cannot be proven with evidence.


**Examples:**

* **Weak:**  "Shakespeare was a great writer."
* **Strong:**  "Shakespeare's use of iambic pentameter in Hamlet enhances the play's dramatic tension and emotional impact."
