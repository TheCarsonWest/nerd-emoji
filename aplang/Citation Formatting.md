# [[Synthesis Essay Strategies]]
# [[Citation Formatting]]

This note covers the basics of citation formatting, focusing on different styles.  I'll need to create separate notes for specific style guides.

**Key Concepts:**

* **In-text citations:**  Brief references within the text, usually author-year or a numerical system.  Example: (Smith, 2023) or 1.
* **Bibliography/Works Cited/References:** A complete list of all cited sources at the end of the document.  This list should be consistent with the in-text citations.
* **Citation Style Guides:**  Sets of rules for formatting citations.  Different fields (e.g., humanities, sciences) often have preferred styles.  Examples: APA, MLA, Chicago.


**Common Citation Style Guides:**

* [[APA Style Guide]]
* [[MLA Style Guide]]
* [[Chicago Style Guide]]


**Basic In-Text Citation Structures:**

* **Author-Year (e.g., APA):**  (Author's Last Name, Year).  For multiple authors: (Author 1 & Author 2, Year) or (Author 1 et al., Year) for more than two.
* **Numerical (e.g., some scientific journals):**  A number corresponding to the entry in the bibliography.  Example: 1.

**Bibliography Entry Elements:**

The specific elements required vary across style guides but generally include:

* Author(s)
* Year of publication
* Title of work
* Publication information (journal, book publisher, website, etc.)
* DOI or URL (when applicable)


**Example:**

Let's consider a simple example using APA style.

In-text citation:  The effects of climate change are significant (IPCC, 2021).

Bibliography entry:

IPCC. (2021). *Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change*. Cambridge University Press.  $DOI: 10.1017/9781009157896$


**Further Considerations:**

* **Software tools:**  Zotero, Mendeley, and other citation managers can automate the process. [[Citation Management Software]]
* **Direct quotes vs. paraphrases:**  Different formatting rules apply. [[Quoting vs. Paraphrasing]]
* $Number \, of \, authors$:  The formatting changes depending on the number of authors.  [[Number of Authors in Citations]]
* **Different Source Types:** Books, journal articles, websites, etc. all have different formatting rules. [[Different Source Types]]


This is a basic framework.  I need to fill in the details for each citation style.
