# [[Rhetorical Analysis]] Techniques]]
# [[Identifying Tone]]

**Definition:** Tone refers to the author's attitude toward the subject matter and the audience.  It's the emotional coloring of the writing, conveyed through word choice, sentence structure, imagery, and figurative language.

**Key Elements to Consider:**

* **Diction:**  Word choice.  Formal vs. informal, positive vs. negative, concrete vs. abstract.  Examples:  *somber*, *jubilant*, *sarcastic*, *ironic*.
* **Syntax:** Sentence structure. Short, choppy sentences can convey urgency or tension, while long, flowing sentences might suggest calmness or reflection.
* **Imagery & Figurative [[Language]]:**  The use of metaphors, similes, personification, etc., contributes significantly to the tone.  A simile comparing something to a "stormy sea" suggests a different tone than one comparing it to a "gentle stream."
* **Point of View:** The narrator's perspective (first person, second person, third person) impacts tone.  A first-person narrative might feel more personal and intimate, while a third-person omniscient narrative could be more detached and objective.

**[[Identifying Tone]] in Practice:**

[[1]]. **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to every word and sentence.  Don't skim.
[[2]]. **Annotate:** Underline or highlight words and phrases that evoke a particular emotion or feeling.
[[3]]. **Consider the context:** The historical, social, and cultural context of the text can influence the tone.
[[4]]. **Look for patterns:**  Are there recurring words or phrases that suggest a particular attitude?
[[5]]. **Consider the overall effect:** What is the author trying to achieve by using this particular tone?


**Common Tones:**

* **Humorous:**  Lighthearted, amusing, intended to evoke laughter.
* **Serious:**  Grave, solemn, thoughtful.
* **Formal:**  Proper, polite, respectful.
* **Informal:**  Casual, conversational, relaxed.
* **Nostalgic:**  Sentimental, yearning for the past.
* **Sarcastic:**  Mocking, ironic, often implying the opposite of what is literally stated.
* $Tone = f(Diction, Syntax, Imagery, Point\ of\ View)$

**Example:**

The sentence "The rain poured down in relentless sheets, drowning the city in a gray despair," uses strong imagery and diction (relentless, drowning, gray despair) to create a somber and depressing tone.  The syntax – a single, descriptive sentence – reinforces this feeling.
