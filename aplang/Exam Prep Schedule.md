* **Active Recall:** Test yourself frequently without looking at your notes.
* **[[Practice Problems]]:** Solve as many problems as possible.
* **Study Groups:** Collaborate with classmates for better understanding.

**Daily Schedule Template:**

* **Morning (8:00 AM - 12:00 PM):** Focus on one topic. Review notes and solve problems.
* **Afternoon (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM):** Work on a different topic. Practice past exam questions.
* **Evening (6:00 PM - 8:00 PM):** Review the day's material. Identify areas needing further attention.
