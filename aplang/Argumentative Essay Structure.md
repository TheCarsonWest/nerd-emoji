# [[Argumentative Essay Structure]]

**I. Introduction**

*   **Hook:**  Start with a compelling hook to grab the reader's attention.  Examples:  anecdote, startling statistic, relevant quote, thought-provoking question.
*   **Background Information:** Provide context for your argument. Briefly explain the issue and its significance.
*   **Thesis Statement:** Clearly state your position on the issue. This is the main argument you will be defending throughout your essay.  It should be concise, specific, and arguable.  $Thesis =  Main\ Argument + Supporting\ Points$

**II. Body Paragraphs (3-5)**

Each body paragraph should focus on a single supporting argument for your thesis.

*   **Topic Sentence:**  Each paragraph begins with a topic sentence that clearly states the main point of that paragraph. This should directly support the thesis statement.
*   **Evidence:** Provide strong evidence to support your claims. This could include:
    *   Statistics
    *   Examples
    *   Expert opinions
    *   Anecdotes
    *   Research findings
*   **Analysis:** Explain how your evidence supports your argument. Don't just present the evidence; analyze its significance and connect it back to your thesis.  [[Evidence Analysis Techniques]]
*   **Counterargument & Rebuttal (Optional but Recommended):** Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments to your claim.  Show why your argument is stronger. [[Counterargument Strategies]]


**III. Conclusion**

*   **Restate Thesis (in different words):**  Summarize your main argument without simply repeating the introduction.
*   **Summarize Main Points:** Briefly review the key supporting arguments you presented.
*   **Concluding Statement:**  Leave the reader with a lasting impression.  This could be a call to action, a prediction, or a final thought that reinforces the significance of your argument.


**IV. Overall Structure & Considerations:**

*   **Logical Flow:** Ensure a smooth and logical progression of ideas between paragraphs. Use transitions to connect your thoughts. [[Transition Words and Phrases]]
*   **Formal Tone:** Maintain a formal and objective tone throughout the essay. Avoid slang, contractions, and personal opinions unless explicitly relevant to the argument.
*   **Citation:**  Properly cite all sources using a consistent citation style (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.). [[Citation Styles]]


**V.  Example Argument Structure:**

Let's say the thesis is:  "The widespread use of social media negatively impacts the mental health of teenagers."

*   **Paragraph [[1:**  Focus on cyberbullying and its effects.
*   **Paragraph 2:** Explore the link between social media usage and feelings of inadequacy/low self-esteem due to social comparison.
*   **Paragraph 3:**  Discuss the impact of social media addiction on sleep patterns and overall well-being.
*   **Paragraph 4:** Address a counterargument:  "Social media can be a positive tool for connection". Rebuttal:  While true, the negative effects outweigh the positives in this demographic.
