# [[Evidence Evaluation & Citation]]
# [[Source Credibility]]

**Definition:** The extent to which a source of information is considered trustworthy and believable.  This is crucial for evaluating the validity and reliability of information used in research, decision-making, and everyday life.

**Factors Affecting [[Source Credibility]]:**

* **Expertise:**  Does the source possess the necessary knowledge and skills to speak authoritatively on the topic?  $Expertise \propto Knowledge + Skills$
* **Trustworthiness:** Is the source unbiased, objective, and free from conflicts of interest? [[Bias Detection]]
* **Reputation:** What is the source's track record?  Have they been accurate and reliable in the past?  This can be assessed through reputation analysis and reviews.
* **Objectivity:** Does the source present information fairly and without personal opinions or agendas? [[Objectivity vs. Subjectivity]]
* **Timeliness:** Is the information up-to-date and relevant?  Outdated information may be inaccurate or misleading.
* **Consistency:** Does the information align with other credible sources?  Conflicting information warrants further investigation.
* **Evidence:** Does the source provide supporting evidence for its claims?  This could include data, statistics, citations, etc. [[Evidence Evaluation]]
* **Source Type:**  The type of source (e.g., peer-reviewed journal article, news website, blog post) influences its inherent credibility. [[Source Types]]


**Assessing [[Source Credibility]]:**

A structured approach is needed:

[[1. **Identify the source:** Who is providing the information? What are their credentials?
2. **Examine the source's purpose:** What is the goal of the source?  Are they trying to persuade, inform, or entertain?
3. **Evaluate the evidence:**  What evidence is presented to support the claims? Is the evidence sufficient and credible?
4. **Check for bias:** Does the source show any bias or partiality? [[Bias Detection]]
5. **Compare to other sources:** Does the information align with what other credible sources say?
6. **Consider the context:**  What is the overall context of the information?  Does it fit within a broader narrative?

**Consequences of Low [[Source Credibility]]:**

* Misinformation and disinformation
* Poor decision-making
* Erosion of trust
* Damage to reputation


**Mathematical Model (Simplified):**

While a precise mathematical model is complex, a simplified representation could be:

$$ Credibility = w_1 \times Expertise + w_2 \times Trustworthiness + w_3 \times Reputation + w_4 \times Objectivity $$

where $w_i$ are weights representing the relative importance of each factor.  The specific weights would depend on the context.
