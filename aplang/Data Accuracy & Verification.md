# [[Evidence Evaluation & Citation]]
# [[Data Accuracy & Verification]]

**Goal:** Understand and implement strategies for ensuring data accuracy and verifying its integrity.


**Key Aspects:**

* **Data Sources:** [[Data Source Evaluation]]  -  Identify potential biases and inaccuracies inherent in different data sources (e.g., surveys, sensors, databases).  Consider factors like sampling methods, measurement errors, and data collection procedures.
* **Data Cleaning:** [[Data Cleaning Techniques]] - Techniques to handle missing values ($$ \text{Missing Data Percentage} = \frac{\text{Number of Missing Values}}{\text{Total Number of Values}} \times 100 $$), outliers ($$ \text{Outlier Detection using IQR: } \text{Upper Bound} = Q_3 + [[1]].[[5]] \times IQR; \text{Lower Bound} = Q_1 - [[1]].[[5]] \times IQR $$), and inconsistencies. This might involve imputation, smoothing, or removal of problematic data points.
* **Data Validation:** [[Data Validation Rules]] - Define rules and constraints to ensure data conforms to expected formats and ranges.  Examples include:
    * **Range checks:**  $x \ge 0$  for a variable representing age.
    * **Format checks:** Ensuring date fields adhere to YYYY-MM-DD format.
    * **Consistency checks:** Verifying that related fields are logically consistent (e.g., birth date < current date).
* **Data Verification:** [[Verification Methods]] - Employ techniques to confirm the accuracy of data after cleaning and validation.  This could include:
    * **Cross-referencing:** Comparing data with other sources to identify discrepancies.
    * **Reconciliation:** Matching data from different systems or processes.
    * **Auditing:**  Formal review of data collection, processing, and storage procedures.
* **Data Quality Metrics:** [[Data Quality Metrics]] - Quantify data accuracy using metrics such as:
    * **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances.
    * **Completeness:** The percentage of non-missing values.
    * **Consistency:** The degree to which data conforms to predefined rules and constraints.
* **[[Error Handling]]:** [[Error Handling Strategies]]  - Develop procedures for identifying, reporting, and correcting data errors. Establish a process for tracking and resolving data quality issues.  A workflow diagram might be helpful here.
