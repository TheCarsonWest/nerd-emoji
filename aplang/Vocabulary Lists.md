**Goal:** Create effective and efficient vocabulary learning systems.

**Methods:**

* **Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS):** [[SRS Implementation]]  This will involve researching different SRS algorithms (e.g., Leitner system, Anki) and their effectiveness.  We need to decide on a platform and a method for inputting vocabulary.

* **Active Recall:**  Testing yourself frequently is key.  Instead of passively reviewing words, actively try to recall their definitions and usage.  The forgetting curve is important here; $Forgetting = e^{-k t}$, where $k$ is a constant and $t$ is time. [[Forgetting Curve Analysis]]

* **Contextual Learning:** Learning words in context is much more effective than memorizing isolated definitions.  This involves using the words in sentences, reading texts containing the words, and even creating your own examples.  [[Contextual Learning Techniques]]

* **Mnemonics:**  Using memory aids like acronyms, rhymes, or visual imagery can significantly improve retention.  [[Mnemonic Strategies]]

* **Vocabulary List Structure:**
    * **Categorization:** Organize words thematically (e.g., by topic, part of speech).
    * **Etymology:** Understanding word origins can help with memorization and understanding nuances of meaning. [[Etymology Resources]]
    * **Example Sentences:** Include at least three example sentences for each word, showing different uses and contexts.
    * **Synonyms & Antonyms:**  Including these helps build richer vocabulary understanding and improves fluency.


* **Tools & Resources:**
    * Anki
    * Memrise
    * Flashcard apps
    * Online dictionaries (e.g., Merriam-Webster, Oxford [[Dictionaries]])


* **Evaluation:** Track progress using metrics like words learned per day/week, retention rate after a specific period, and overall vocabulary size. [[Progress Tracking & Metrics]]


**Further Research:**

* The impact of different learning styles on vocabulary acquisition.
* The optimal number of words to learn per day.
* The effectiveness of different mnemonic techniques.
* The role of spaced repetition in long-term retention.


## $$RetentionRate = \frac{WordsRecalled}{WordsLearned} \times 100\%$$


This formula will be used to calculate retention rate in [[Progress Tracking & Metrics]].
