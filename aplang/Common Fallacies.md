These notes cover common logical fallacies.  Referencing them will improve argumentation and critical thinking skills.

**I. Fallacies of Relevance (Red Herrings):**  These fallacies distract from the main argument.

* **Ad hominem:** Attacking the person making the argument instead of the argument itself.  Example: "You can't believe anything he says; he's a liar!"  This doesn't address the validity of his statement.

* **Appeal to authority:** Claiming something is true simply because an authority figure said it, without further evidence. Example: "My doctor said it, so it must be true." [[Appeal to Authority Fallacy]]

* **Appeal to emotion:** Manipulating emotions instead of using logic.  Example:  "Think of the children!" used to justify a policy without evidence of its effectiveness. [[Appeal to Emotion Fallacy]]

* **Red herring:** Introducing an irrelevant topic to divert attention from the main issue. Example: "You're criticizing my environmental policy, but what about the national debt?"

* **Straw man:** Misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack. Example: Person A: "We should reduce military spending." Person B: "So you want to leave our country defenseless?!"


**II. Fallacies of Ambiguity:** These fallacies arise from unclear or misleading language.

* **Equivocation:** Using a word with multiple meanings in a way that obscures the argument. Example:  "The sign said 'fine for parking here,' and since it's fine to park here, I parked."

* **Amphiboly:**  A grammatical ambiguity that allows for multiple interpretations.  Example: "I saw the man with binoculars." (Did *I* have the binoculars, or did the man?)


**III. Fallacies of Presumption:** These fallacies make unwarranted assumptions.

* **Begging the question (circular reasoning):** The conclusion is assumed in the premise. Example: "God exists because the Bible says so, and the Bible is the word of God."

* **False dilemma (either/or fallacy):** Presenting only two options when more exist. Example: "You're either with us or against us."

* **Hasty generalization:** Drawing a conclusion based on insufficient evidence. Example: "I met two rude people from that city, so everyone from there must be rude."

* **Post hoc ergo propter hoc (false cause):** Assuming that because one event followed another, the first event caused the second. Example: "I wore my lucky socks, and we won the game; therefore, my socks caused us to win." $P(A|B) \neq P(B|A)$ [[Correlation vs. Causation]]

* **Slippery slope:** Arguing that one event will inevitably lead to a series of negative consequences without sufficient evidence. Example: "If we legalize marijuana, then everyone will become addicted to heroin."

* **Composition/Division:** Assuming that what is true of the parts is true of the whole (composition), or vice versa (division). Example:  "Each player on the team is a great athlete, therefore the team is a great team." (Composition)


**IV.  Other Fallacies:**

* **Bandwagon fallacy:** Claiming something is true because it's popular.
