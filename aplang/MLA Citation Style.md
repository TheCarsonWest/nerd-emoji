# [[Evidence Evaluation & Citation]]
# [[MLA Citation Style]] Notes

**I. Core Components:**

*   **In-text citations:**  These appear within the text of your paper and briefly identify the source.  The format generally follows the author's last name and the page number(s), e.g., (Smith 123).  If there is no page number (like for websites), use the paragraph number or a section heading if available. $Example: (Smith, para. 3)$

*   **Works Cited page:** This is a separate page at the end of your paper that lists all sources cited in alphabetical order by the first element of the citation (usually the author's last name).  Each entry follows a specific format depending on the source type (book, article, website, etc.).

**II. Source Types & Formatting:**

*   **Books:**  Author's last name, Author's first name. *Title of Book*. Publisher, Year.  
    *Example:* Smith, John. *The Great Gatsby*. Penguin Classics, 2010.

*   **Journal Articles:** Author's last name, Author's first name. "Article Title." *Journal Title*, vol. number, no. number, year, pages.  
    *Example:* Doe, Jane. "The Impact of Social Media." *Journal of Communication*, vol. 70, no. 2, 2020, pp. 300-320.  [[Journal Article Formatting]]

*   **Websites:**  Author's last name, Author's first name (if available). "Title of Page." *Website Name*, date of publication or last update, URL. 
    *Example:*  Jones, Sarah. "MLA Style Guide." *Purdue OWL*, 1 Oct. 2023, https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/index.html. [[Website Citation Examples]]


**III.  Special Cases:**

*   **Multiple Authors:** List authors in the order they appear on the source. Use "and" before the last author in the Works Cited entry. For in-text citations with 3+ authors, use the first author's last name followed by "et al." ($Example: (Smith et al. 45)$)  [[Multiple Author Citations]]

*   **No Author:** If no author is listed, use the title of the work (or a shortened version if it's long) in place of the author's name.

*   **Indirect Sources:** If you cite a source that was cited in another source, indicate this in your citation.  $Example: (Smith, qtd. in Jones 100)$  [[Indirect Sources]]
