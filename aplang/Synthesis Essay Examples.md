**Goal:** Understand the structure and components of effective synthesis essays.  This will involve analyzing examples and identifying key features.

**Key Components:**

* **Thesis Statement:**  The central argument, which should clearly state the writer's position on the issue.  It needs to be arguable and not simply a summary of the sources. $Thesis =  Argument + Synthesis of Sources$

* **Source Integration:**  This is crucial.  Sources must be smoothly integrated, not just summarized.  Use signal phrases effectively (e.g., "According to X...", "As Y argues...").  Proper citation is vital.  [[Citation Methods]]

* **Analysis & Synthesis:**  Don't just present the sources; analyze them.  Compare and contrast different perspectives, identify common themes, and explain how they support your thesis.  This is the "synthesis" part â€“ creating something new from existing material.

* **Counterarguments:**  Acknowledge and address opposing viewpoints. This strengthens your argument by demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the topic. [[Counterargument Strategies]]

* **Conclusion:**  Restate the thesis in a new way, summarizing key findings and emphasizing the significance of your synthesis.  Avoid introducing new information here.
