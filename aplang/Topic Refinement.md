# [[Recommended Reading List]]
# [[Topic Refinement]] Notes

**Goal:**  Refine the topic "[[Topic Refinement]]" into a manageable and researchable scope.

**Current Status:**  Too broad.  Needs significant narrowing.

**Possible Refinement Approaches:**

1. **Focus on a specific methodology:**
    * [[Topic Refinement Methodologies]]  (This will be a separate note)
    *  Examples:  Keyword analysis, mind mapping, literature review, stakeholder interviews.  Consider focusing on *one* specific methodology.

2. **Focus on a specific application area:**
    * [[Topic Refinement in Scientific Research]] (This will be a separate note)
    * [[Topic Refinement in Project Management]] (This will be a separate note)
    * [[Topic Refinement in Marketing]] (This will be a separate note)
    * Choosing a specific field will provide a more concrete context.


3. **Focus on a specific problem related to topic refinement:**
    * For example,  the problem of identifying biases in topic selection, or overcoming writer's block during the refinement process.
    * [[Bias in Topic Selection]] (This will be a separate note)
    * [[Overcoming Writer's Block in Topic Refinement]] (This will be a separate note)


4. **Consider the scope of the research:**
    * Will this be a short, focused piece, or a long, in-depth analysis?  This will significantly influence the level of refinement needed.
    * [[Scope and Depth of Research]] (This will be a separate note)


**Evaluation Metrics:**

* **Specificity:**  How precisely is the topic defined?
* **Feasibility:**  Is it possible to research this topic within the available resources (time, data, etc.)?
* **Relevance:**  Is the topic relevant to the intended audience and purpose?
* **Interest:**  Is the topic engaging and likely to produce insightful results?


**Mathematical Modeling (If applicable):**

While not directly applicable to all refinement approaches, some aspects might benefit from a quantitative analysis.  For instance, if using keyword analysis, we might use metrics like:

* **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):** $TF-IDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) \times IDF(t)$
* **Keyword density:** $Keyword \; Density = \frac{Number \; of \; Keywords}{Total \; Number \; of \; Words}$


Further refinement will require choosing ONE of the above approaches and further developing the chosen direction.  This may require iterative refinement of the topic itself.


**Next Steps:**

1. Choose ONE refinement approach from the list above.
2. Create a detailed outline for the chosen approach, referencing other relevant notes (created from the list above).
3. Begin literature review and research.
