# [[Synthesis Essay]]
# [[Source Integration Techniques]]

This document outlines various techniques for integrating sources into a written work.  Focus is on proper attribution and avoiding plagiarism.

## [[Citation Management]]

*   Different citation styles (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.)  [[Citation Styles]]
*   Software tools (Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote) [[Citation Management Software]]


## Direct Quotations

*   Use sparingly.  Overuse weakens writing.
*   Always enclose in quotation marks.
*   Introduce quote with signal phrase (e.g., "According to Smith...")
*   Include page number (or equivalent) in citation.

Example: "This is a direct quote" (Smith 123).


## Paraphrasing

*   Restate information in your own words.
*   Maintain original meaning.
*   Always cite the source.

Example: Smith argues that... (Smith 123).


## Summarizing

*   Condensing main ideas from a source.
*   Focus on key arguments and evidence.
*   Cite the source.

Example:  The study's findings support the hypothesis that... (Smith et al., 2023).


## Synthesizing Sources

*   Combining information from multiple sources to support your argument.
*   Show how sources relate to each other.
*   Avoid simply listing sources; create a cohesive narrative.  [[Synthesis Techniques]]


## [[Avoiding Plagiarism]]

*   Proper citation is crucial.
*   Paraphrase and summarize effectively.
*   Use quotation marks correctly.
*   Understand your institution's plagiarism policy. [[Academic Honesty]]


##  Mathematical Formula Integration (Example)

Suppose we have a function $f(x) = x^[[2]]$.  The integral of this function from $a$ to $b$ is given by:

$$ \int_a^b x^[[2]] dx = \left[ \frac{x^[[3]]}{[[3]]} \right]_a^b = \frac{b^[[3]]}{[[3]]} - \frac{a^[[3]]}{[[3]]} $$

This needs to be cited if taken from a source.  Remember to cite the source of the formula if it's not common knowledge.  [[Mathematical Citation]]


##  Image and Figure Integration

*   Always cite the source of images and figures, even if they are from the public domain. [[Image Attribution]]


##  Data Integration

*   Clearly state the source of data.
*   Explain any transformations or manipulations performed on the data. [[Data Handling and Citation]]
