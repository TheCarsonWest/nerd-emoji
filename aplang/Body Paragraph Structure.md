# [[Argumentative Essay]]
# [[Body Paragraph Structure]]

**Core Components:**

[[1]]. **Topic Sentence:**  This sentence introduces the main idea of the paragraph. It should directly relate to the thesis statement.  It needs to be clear, concise, and arguable.

[[2]]. **Supporting Evidence:** This section provides the evidence to back up the topic sentence. This can include:
    * **Facts:**  Verifiable pieces of information.
    * **Statistics:** Numerical data.
    * **Examples:** Specific instances that illustrate the point.
    * **Anecdotes:** Brief stories that support the claim.
    * **Expert Opinions:** Quotations from authorities on the subject.  [[Citation Management]]

[[3]]. **Analysis/Explanation:** This section explains how the evidence supports the topic sentence and the overall argument. It's crucial to connect the evidence to the main point and avoid simply listing facts.  This section shows *why* the evidence matters.

[[4]]. **Transition:**  A sentence (or phrase) that smoothly connects this paragraph to the next.  It creates a logical flow of ideas.


**Equation for ideal paragraph length:**

While there's no magic number, a good rule of thumb is to aim for $[[5]]-[[7]]$ sentences.  This can vary depending on the complexity of the argument and the length of the evidence.


**Common Errors to Avoid:**

* **Off-topic sentences:**  Every sentence should directly support the topic sentence.
* **Insufficient evidence:**  Provide enough evidence to convince the reader.
* **Weak analysis:**  Don't just present evidence; explain its significance.
* **Lack of transitions:**  Smooth transitions are crucial for a coherent argument.


**Advanced Techniques:**

* **Using different types of evidence:** Varying your evidence strengthens your argument.
* **Developing complex analysis:**  Go beyond surface-level explanations.
* **Integrating quotations effectively:** [[Quoting Sources Effectively]]

**Example Paragraph Structure:**

The topic sentence will be:  *The widespread use of social media has significantly impacted interpersonal communication.*

Then, you will add supporting evidence such as:  *A recent study showed a correlation between increased social media use and a decrease in face-to-face interaction.*

Following the evidence, an analysis will be added:  *This suggests that while social media offers connectivity, it may be diminishing the quality of direct human interaction.*

Then, add another point of evidence: *Furthermore, the prevalence of online communication often leads to misunderstandings due to the absence of nonverbal cues.*

Finally, conclude with an analysis connecting the evidence to the topic sentence:  *Consequently, the reliance on digital platforms for communication might be hindering the development of essential social skills and authentic connection.*
