# [[Purpose & Intent]]

**Purpose:**  The overall goal or objective. What is the desired outcome?  What problem are we trying to solve?

**Intent:** The plan or strategy to achieve the purpose. How will we reach the desired outcome?  What are the specific steps or actions involved?


**Relationship between Purpose and Intent:** The purpose defines *what* needs to be accomplished, while the intent defines *how* it will be accomplished.  A strong purpose provides direction, while a clear intent provides a roadmap.


**Examples:**

* **Purpose:** Increase website traffic.
* **Intent:** Implement an SEO strategy focusing on keyword research, content marketing, and social media promotion.  [[SEO Strategy]] [[Content Marketing]] [[Social Media Marketing]]

**Measuring Success:**  How will we know if we've achieved our purpose and successfully executed our intent?  This requires defining key performance indicators (KPIs). [[KPIs]]

**Formulating Purpose and Intent:**

A useful framework is the SMART criteria:

* **Specific:** Clearly defined and unambiguous.
* **Measurable:** Quantifiable with specific metrics.
* **Achievable:** Realistic and attainable within the given constraints.
* **Relevant:** Aligned with overall goals and objectives.
* **Time-bound:** Defined with clear deadlines.

Consider using the following formula to ensure clarity:

"Our purpose is to $achieve \ X$ by $Y$ date. Our intent is to achieve this by $doing \ Z$."  For example: "Our purpose is to increase website traffic by 20% by the end of the year. Our intent is to achieve this by implementing an SEO strategy, focusing on keyword research, content marketing and social media promotion."
