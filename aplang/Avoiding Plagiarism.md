# [[Evidence Evaluation & Citation]]
# [[Avoiding Plagiarism]]

**Key Concepts:**

* **Plagiarism:** Presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own, intentionally or unintentionally.  This includes text, images, code, and even ideas.

* **Types of Plagiarism:**
    * **Direct Plagiarism:** Copying text verbatim without quotation marks or citation.
    * **Self-Plagiarism:** Submitting your own previous work for a new assignment without permission.
    * **Mosaic Plagiarism:** Paraphrasing someone else's work without proper attribution.  This often involves changing a few words but retaining the original sentence structure and ideas.
    * **Accidental Plagiarism:**  Occurs when proper citation is not used, often due to poor note-taking or misunderstanding of citation guidelines.

* **Consequences of Plagiarism:**
    * Academic: Failing grades, suspension, expulsion.
    * Professional: Damage to reputation, loss of credibility, potential legal action.


**Strategies for [[Avoiding Plagiarism]]:**

[[1. **Proper Note-Taking:** [[Note-Taking Strategies]]  Keep track of your sources meticulously.  Use a consistent method (e.g., notecards, a dedicated notebook, a citation manager like Zotero or Mendeley).  Clearly distinguish between your ideas and those you've gathered from other sources.

[[2]. **Paraphrasing and Summarizing:**  Don't just change a few words;  restate the information in your own words, focusing on understanding the core concepts.  Then cite the original source.

[[3]. **Quoting Accurately:** Use quotation marks for any direct quotes, even short phrases.  Always cite the source. The length of a quote should be determined by its relevance, with short quotes being preferable unless the exact wording is crucial.

[[4]. **[[Citation Styles]]:** [[Citation Styles: MLA, APA, Chicago]] Learn the rules of a specific citation style (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.) and apply them consistently.  Different disciplines often have preferred styles.  Each citation should include all necessary information (author, title, publication date, etc.).

[[5]. **Understanding Fair Use:** [[Fair Use Guidelines]] Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis and is complex.  When in doubt, it's best to obtain permission.

[[6]. **Original Work:** Strive to develop your own arguments and perspectives. Build upon the existing research, but make sure your contributions are original.


**Tools to Help Avoid Plagiarism:**

* **Plagiarism Checkers:**  These software programs can detect instances of plagiarism by comparing your work to a large database of sources. However, they are not foolproof and shouldn't be the sole method of ensuring originality.  They are best used as a secondary check to identify areas that need further review and modification.
* **Citation Management Software:** Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote â€“ these tools help you organize your sources and generate citations automatically.

**Example of a correctly cited sentence:**

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" ($a_i = \sum_{i=[[1}^n x_i$).  (Smith, 2023, p. 10).

**Equation Example:** The Pythagorean theorem is represented by the equation:

$$ a^[[2] + b^[[2] = c^[[2] $$


This demonstrates proper citation of a quote and the inclusion of an equation. Remember to adapt this structure to your specific needs and chosen citation style.
