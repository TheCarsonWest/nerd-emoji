This note covers methods and considerations for comparative analysis.

**I. Types of [[Comparative Analysis]]:**

* **Qualitative [[Comparative Analysis]] (QCA):**  Useful for exploring causal relationships in small-N cases.  Focuses on configurations of conditions leading to outcomes.  [[QCA Methods]]
* **Quantitative [[Comparative Analysis]]:** Uses statistical methods to compare groups or variables across multiple cases.  Allows for broader generalizations but may require larger datasets and strong assumptions. [[Statistical Methods in Comparative Analysis]]
* **Most Similar Systems Design (MSSD):** Compares similar cases to isolate the impact of a specific variable.  Helps control for confounding factors. [[MSSD Example]]
* **Most Different Systems Design (MDSD):** Compares dissimilar cases that share a common outcome to identify necessary conditions.  Helps establish causal mechanisms. [[MDSD Example]]
* **Within-Case Comparison:** Examining different aspects or periods within a single case to understand causal processes. [[Within-Case Analysis]]

**II. Key Considerations:**

* **Case Selection:**  Crucial for the validity of comparative analysis.  Bias can be introduced through selective inclusion or exclusion of cases.  Consider using strategies like MSSD or MDSD to mitigate bias. [[Case Selection Bias]]
* **Variable Measurement:**  Standardizing measurement across cases is critical for accurate comparisons.  Consider using comparable indicators and controlling for measurement error. [[Measurement Issues]]
* **Causal Inference:**  Establishing causality requires careful consideration of potential confounding factors and alternative explanations.  Use of statistical controls or process tracing can strengthen causal inferences. [[Causal Inference in Comparative Research]]
* **Generalizability:** The extent to which findings can be generalized depends on the representativeness of the selected cases.  Consider limitations of small-N studies. [[Generalizability and External Validity]]


**III.  Statistical Techniques (Linked to [[Statistical Methods in Comparative Analysis]]):**

* **Regression Analysis:**  $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \dots + \epsilon$  where $Y$ is the dependent variable and $X_i$ are independent variables.
* **t-tests:** Used to compare the means of two groups.
* **ANOVA:** Used to compare the means of three or more groups.
* **Chi-squared test:** Used to test for association between categorical variables.


**IV.  Data Sources:**

*  Primary Data: [[Primary Data Collection]]
*  Secondary Data: [[Secondary Data Sources]]


**V.  Example Comparative Research Questions:**

* What are the factors contributing to economic growth in different countries?
* How do different political systems impact levels of social inequality?
* What are the causes of civil war?


This is a starting point for my comparative analysis notes.  I'll add more detail to each sub-section as needed.
