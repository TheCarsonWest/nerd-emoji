# [[Authorial Purpose]]

The author's purpose is the reason an author writes a text.  It's the main goal or intention behind the creation of the work. This can be multifaceted and complex, but usually falls under a few key categories.

**Key Categories of [[Authorial Purpose]]:**

* **To inform:**  The author aims to educate the reader, provide factual information, or explain a concept.  Examples include textbooks, news articles, and scientific papers.
* **To persuade:** The author attempts to convince the reader to adopt a particular viewpoint or take a specific action.  Examples include political speeches, advertisements, and opinion pieces.
* **To entertain:** The author seeks to amuse, engage, or captivate the reader. Examples include novels, short stories, and humorous essays.
* **To express:** The author shares personal feelings, experiences, or thoughts. Examples include poems, memoirs, and personal essays.


**Identifying [[Authorial Purpose]]:**

Analyzing authorial purpose requires close reading and critical thinking.  Consider the following:

* **The text's content:** What information is presented? What arguments are made? What emotions are evoked?
* **The author's tone:** Is the tone formal or informal?  Serious or humorous?  Objective or subjective?
* **The author's style:**  What literary devices are used? How is the language used to create meaning?
* **The intended audience:** Who is the author trying to reach? How might this influence the author's purpose?


**Examples:**

* A scientific paper on climate change likely has the purpose of **informing** readers about the current state of climate science.
* A political campaign advertisement aims to **persuade** voters to support a particular candidate.
* A novel might have the primary purpose of **entertaining** readers with a compelling story.
* A poem might primarily **express** the author's feelings about a particular event or experience.


**Mathematical Representation (for illustrative purposes only):**

While not directly quantifiable, we can represent the influence of different purposes with a weighted sum.  Let's say:

$I$ = Informative purpose
$P$ = Persuasive purpose
$E$ = Entertaining purpose
$X$ = Expressive purpose

Then the overall authorial purpose ($A$) could be represented as a weighted sum:

$$A = w_I I + w_P P + w_E E + w_X X$$

where $w_I$, $w_P$, $w_E$, and $w_X$ are weights representing the relative importance of each purpose (0 ≤ $w_i$ ≤ [[1]] and $\sum w_i = [[1]]$).
