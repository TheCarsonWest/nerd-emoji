# [[Exam Prep Schedule]]
# [[Past Exams]]

These notes are for reviewing past exams to identify recurring themes and improve exam performance.

**Key Areas to Analyze:**

* **Frequency of Question Types:**  Track how often certain question types (e.g., multiple choice, short answer, essay) appear.  This helps prioritize study time.  $P(type_i) = \frac{n_i}{N}$, where $n_i$ is the number of questions of type $i$ and $N$ is the total number of questions.

* **Topics Covered:**  Identify the most frequently tested topics.  This informs study focus.  Create a frequency distribution to visualize this. [[Topic Frequency Analysis]]

* **Difficulty Level:** Assess the difficulty of past exam questions. [[Difficulty Assessment]]  This can be done by analyzing the average score on each question or by using a rubric.

* **Common Mistakes:** Analyze common errors made on past exams to identify areas needing improvement. [[Common Mistakes Analysis]]

* **Time Management:**  Evaluate how long it took to answer questions and adjust time allocation strategies for future exams. [[Time Management Strategies]]


**Example Exam Analysis:**

Let's say we have analyzed three past exams:

* **Exam [[1:**  Covered topics A, B, C.  Emphasis on short answer.
* **Exam 2:** Covered topics B, D, E. Emphasis on multiple choice and problem solving.
* **Exam 3:** Covered topics A, C, E. Balanced mix of question types.

This suggests that topics A, B, and E are frequently tested. Short answer and multiple choice questions are common. [[Exam 1 Analysis]], [[Exam 2 Analysis]], [[Exam 3 Analysis]]


**Actionable Steps:**

* Review notes on frequently tested topics.
* Practice solving different question types.
* Focus on areas where past performance was weak.
* Develop a time management strategy for exam day.


## $$ \text{Average Score} = \frac{\sum_{i=[[1}^{N} S_i}{N} $$

Where $S_i$ is the score on question $i$ and $N$ is the total number of questions.  This helps gauge overall performance and identify areas needing improvement.
