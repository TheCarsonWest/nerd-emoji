Derivatives represent the **instantaneous rate of change** of a function.  This has various applications in real-world scenarios. 
## Steps to Solve Contextual Problems Involving Derivatives

1. **Identify the function:** Determine the function that describes the relationship between the variables involved.
2. **Identify the variable you want to differentiate:** This will depend on the question being asked.
3. **Calculate the derivative:** Use the appropriate differentiation rules to find the derivative of the function.
4. **Interpret the result:** Explain the meaning of the derivative in the context of the problem.

## [[Implicit Differentiation]] 

[[Implicit Differentiation]] is a technique used to find the derivative of a function that is not explicitly defined as $y = f(x)$. Instead, the function is defined by an equation that implicitly relates $x$ and $y$, or any other variable you may see.

## Examples

**Example 1:** Find the slope of the tangent line to the curve defined by the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ at the point $(3, 4)$.

1. **Differentiate both sides:** 
$$2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$
2. **Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$:**
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}$$
3. **Substitute the point (3, 4):**
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{3}{4}$$

Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at the point $(3, 4)$ is $-\frac{3}{4}$.

**Example 2:**  Find the rate of change of the radius of a circle with respect to its area, given that the area is increasing at a rate of $10 \pi$ square units per second.

1. **Identify the equation:** The area of a circle is given by $A = \pi r^2$.
2. **Differentiate both sides:**
$$\frac{dA}{dt} = 2\pi r \frac{dr}{dt}$$
3. **Substitute the given information:** 
$$10 \pi = 2\pi r \frac{dr}{dt}$$
4. **Solve for $\frac{dr}{dt}$:**
$$\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{5}{r}$$

Therefore, the rate of change of the radius with respect to its area is $\frac{5}{r}$ units per second.
