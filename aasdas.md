Hey Coach Caleb!

I hope this email finds you well and that your team’s season is progressing smoothly. I wanted to take a moment to share an update on my swimming season and some of the challenges and progress I’ve experienced thus far.

This season has been a bit unconventional for our team due to unforeseen circumstances. In September, our pool underwent renovations, which limited our training opportunities. More recently, we faced an unexpected development with a gastrointestinal parasite affecting our pools and sidelining much of our team. Despite these obstacles, my training group has remained resilient, making the most of the pool time we have and tackling these challenges head-on.

In terms of competition, we’ve had a few meets already. One highlight was our duel meet with Dynamo Aquatic Club. While the times were slower than anticipated, the racing was intense and highly competitive. The meet’s atmosphere, complete with an exciting light show, made it a memorable experience for everyone involved.

On a technical front, after consulting with my coach and analyzing my strokes, we identified some issues with my catch that were affecting my performance. I’ve been diligently working to make adjustments during practice. Although these changes might impact my short-term speed, and certainly don't feel normal, I’m confident they will pay off in the long term as I refine my technique.

Looking ahead, I’m particularly excited about our upcoming winter training. Due to the disruptions earlier in the season, we haven’t been able to train at the volumes I’m accustomed to, so I’m eager to push myself during our training trip to Ocala, Florida, from December 26th to January 3rd. The intense schedule of six-hour training days will be challenging, but I’m looking forward to the growth it will bring.

I hope your team’s season is going well, and I look forward to keeping you updated as mine progresses. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss anything further. Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,

Carson West

make a medium-sized(a bit larger than the previous one) update email to coach caleb at cornell saying the following things:
- I hope you are doing well
- Congrats to your swimmers at Ivy League Conference Championships! Congrats on the new 400 Free relay school record and the 7 medals the boys scored. That meet is serious business, I was amazed to see how fast all of the times were that everyone put up.
Incorporate this paragraph somehow
My short course season has been a bit of a struggle, to be honest. I've been dealing with seasonal illness throughout most of the championship season. However, I'm staying consistent with practice and optimistic about getting back to full strength soon. I've also made some significant improvements to my stroke mechanics, which has significantly reduced my stroke rate in my distance events. It's been an adjustment and required a temporary reduction in volume which has affected my endurance in the short-term, but I'm confident it will pay off in the long run. I've also finally made some real progress on my backstroke, which used to be a weak point in my IM. At our championship meet a few weeks ago, my backstroke split in the 400IM was 3.5 seconds faster than my previous personal best!
This paragraph was from like 2 weeks ago in another email, I am back at it 100% and now I am training the hardest I have all year
- Not dropping for an entire season is extremely hard mentally. but I know that there are highs and lows to everything, and that all hardship I face in my life will end up making me a better person than I was before.
- me and my coach have seen the results and have decided to make a change back away from the low-volume technique and back to raw speed and volume. I have one more shot to make good times this season at Speedo Sectionals in Indianapolis, and I hope to get back on track to make my goals for my future in swimming happen. I know my technique is better than its ever been, and over the coming weeks I can get back to the best endurance I'll have ever had, which makes me fully confident in myself to perform
- Best of luck to you and your team for the end of the season!




Subject: Update and Congrats on Ivies!

Hey Coach Caleb,

I hope this email finds you doing well.

First off, huge congratulations to you and your swimmers on an incredible performance at the Ivy League Conference Championships! The new 400 Free Relay school record is amazing, and 7 medals for the boys is a serious accomplishment. That meet is no joke. I was amazed at the times everyone was putting up. 

My short course season has been a bit of a rollercoaster.  I struggled with illness throughout most of the championship season.  While I was able to stay consistent with practice and make some technical improvements, like significantly reducing my stroke rate in distance events and finally figuring out how to swim backstroke(my recent 400IM backstroke split was 3.5 seconds faster than my old 400IM Split!) the illness definitely took a toll.  Because of the stroke work, our training volume has been lower than I am used to, which took a major hit to my endurance for my races.

The good news is that I’m back at it 100% now and training harder than I have all year!  Not dropping times for an entire season has been a mental challenge, but I know that all hardship I face will end up making me better than I was before it.

My coach and I have assessed my situation and decided to shift away from the lower-volume, technique-focused training and back to building raw speed and endurance.  I have one last shot to put up some good times this season at Speedo Sectionals in Indianapolis.  I’m confident that with my improved technique and the work I'm putting in over these next few weeks to rebuild my endurance, I'll be able to get back on track and achieve the goals I've set for my  future in the sport.

Best of luck to you and your team as you finish out the season!

Best regards,
Carson West
