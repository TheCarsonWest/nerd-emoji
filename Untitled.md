1. Armistice: The Great War Ends

Little History Monster 2018

At the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, the
Great War ended. The war was ended by an armistice – an
agreement to stop fighting. Germany, lacking manpower and
supplies and facing an impending invasion, signed an armistice
agreement giving victory to the Allies. The addition of
American troops and resources helped to secure victory for
the Allies.
World War I cost the lives of an estimated 16 million people,
both military and civilian. Millions of civilians died from
disease, starvation or exposure. Industries and farmlands lay
in ruins. The most terrible war the world had experienced was
over. It was up to the Allied Powers to make peace and
determine the best course of action moving forward.

2. Paris Peace Conference

Little History Monster 2018
The armistice of November 11, 1918 officially
ended the fighting, but negotiations were still
needed. Over thirty-two countries joined
together in Paris to write peace treaties with the
defeated nations. For six months participates
worked to establish the terms of peace following
the war.
Although dozens of countries were represented at
the conference, representatives from four
countries dominated the proceedings. The “Big
Four” were the United Kingdom, France, the
United States and Italy. Despite protests, the
defeated Central Powers weren’t allowed to
attend the negotiations. The “Big Four” had
significant disagreements, but eventually the
conference produced the Treaty of Versailles and
established the League of Nations, an
international peacekeeping organization.

3. President Wilson and the 14 Points

Little History Monster 2018

President Woodrow Wilson represented the United
States at the Paris Peace Conference. Wilson sought to
establish lasting peace that was based on reconciliation.
Several leaders wanted to punish those countries
responsible for the war, but Wilson urged an agreement
that would be fair to all nations. His list of proposals
was called the Fourteen Points.
The Fourteen Points was a list of proposals by Wilson
that focused on ensuring an immediate end to the war,
and reducing future conflicts. Wilson’s plan called for an
improvement of international relationships and insisted
on global arms reduction. The last item of the Fourteen
Points called for the creation of an international
peacekeeping organization known as the League of
Nations. Wilson thought the organization could prevent
future conflicts through negotiations. Wilson’s Fourteen
Points were immensely influential in modeling the
postwar world.

4. Terms of the Treaty

Little History Monster 2018

Despite Wilson’s attempt to avoid
punishment of any one nation, the final
treaty enforced tremendously harsh
conditions on Germany. Many countries in
Europe, particularly France, demanded
Germany be punished for the destruction its
armies had caused.
The majority of fighting occurred in France,
causing immense damage. French leaders
wanted revenge. They pleaded that the only
way to gain security and prevent Germany
from attacking again was to reduce it’s
power. France also demanded Germany pay
reparations, or payments for war damages.

The final treaty contained several demands of Germany. The major terms said Germany had to: accept
total responsibility for causing the war, give up some of its land, agree to pay the Allied nations billions of
dollars in war reparations, and decrease the size of their military. Germany protested the harsh terms,
but had to sign or face the possibility of an Allied invasion of their country.

5. The League of Nations

Little History Monster 2018

The League of Nations was established as part of the
Treaty of Versailles. The organization served as an
international peacekeeping organization. The goal of
the League of Nations was to resolve international
conflicts to prevent the outbreak of war.
Although U.S. President Woodrow Wilson proposed
the idea of an international peacekeeping
organization, the United States ended up not joining
the League of Nations. In fact, the U.S. did not sign
the Treaty of Versailles. The U.S. Senate has the
power to approve or reject any treaty regarding
foreign countries. The U.S. Senate refused to approve
the treaty because many feared joining the League of
Nations may drag the U.S. into a future conflict.
Many Americans wanted to return to a foreign policy
of isolationism.

The League of Nations achieved several positive contributions, such as helping to end slavery in parts of
the world. As intended, the organization effectively resolved international conflicts, but failed to prevent
the events that led to World War II.

6. Consequences of the Treaty

Little History Monster 2018

The Treaty of Versailles sought to bring peace
following the most terrible war the world had

experienced. The Treaty was successful short-
term, but caused lingering issues that

contributed to the outbreak of the Second
World War.
Germany was harshly punished by the terms of
the Treaty of Versailles. Germany was forced to
accept blame for the war and had to pay huge
war reparations to the Allied Powers. The
German people were humiliated. Despite
protesting the treaty, Germany had no choice
but to agree to its terms.
As a result of the treaty, Germany was
financially ruined. The country fell into a deep
economic depression, adding to the
embarrassment of the German people. Some
historians believe the difficult terms of the
treaty led to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi
party, which capitalized on German anger
towards the unforgiving burdens enforced by
the Allied Powers following the First World War.

D.  * The "Big Four" are depicted as giants, representing their power and influence.
    * Germany is being forced to ingest the peace terms, symbolized by the large pill.
    * The artist's point of view is critical of the "Big Four" and suggests they are imposing their will on Germany without consideration for its perspective.


## President Wilson and the 14 Points

A. Wilson urged an agreement that would be fair to all nations, based on reconciliation rather than punishment.

B. Wilson's Fourteen Points focused on ensuring an immediate end to the war and reducing future conflicts through measures like open diplomacy, freedom of the seas, arms reduction, and the creation of the League of Nations.

D.  * Germany is at the bottom of the stairs.
    * The star represents peace.
    * The numbers on the stairs represent Wilson's Fourteen Points, indicating Germany must comply with all of them to achieve peace.

A. Germany was harshly punished by the treaty.

B. France insisted on punishment because the majority of the fighting occurred on French soil, causing immense damage. They believed punishing Germany and reducing its power was necessary for future security and as retribution.

C. The major terms of the treaty required Germany to accept total responsibility for causing the war, give up some of its land, pay billions of dollars in war reparations to the Allied nations, and decrease the size of its military.

D.  * "You" refers to the Allies, specifically those who expected to collect reparations.
    * Germany is speaking, expressing doubt that the Allies will be able to collect the massive reparations demanded.


## The League of Nations

A. The League of Nations was an international peacekeeping organization. Its goal was to resolve international conflicts to prevent the outbreak of war.

    * The author's point of view is that the League is incomplete and weakened without the participation of the United States.


## Consequences of the Treaty

B. The treaty contributed to the rise of the Nazi party by creating a climate of humiliation and economic hardship in Germany, which the Nazis exploited to gain support.  They promised to overturn the treaty and restore German pride and power.

C. (Opinion) The treaty was arguably too harsh. While Germany bore responsibility for the war, the severity of the punishments, particularly the massive reparations, crippled the German economy and fostered resentment, creating fertile ground for extremist movements like Nazism. A more balanced approach focusing on rebuilding and reconciliation might have been more effective in preventing future conflict.

D.  * The Nazi party is crawling out of the treaty. This symbolizes the treaty's unintended consequence of contributing to the rise of Nazism.
    * The author's point of view is that the Treaty of Versailles directly led to the rise of the Nazi party and the subsequent horrors of World War II.
