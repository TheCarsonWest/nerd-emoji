Wh e n your secretary invited me to come here, she told me that your Society is concerned with the employment of women and she suggested that Imight tell you some-
thing about my own professional experiences. It is true I am a woman; it is true I am employed; but what professional experiences have I had? It is difficult to say. My profession is literature; and in that profession there are fewer experi- ences for women than in any other, with the exception of the stage - fewer, I mean, that
are peculiar to women. For the road was cut many years ago - by Fanny Burney, by Aphra Behn, by Harriet Martineau, by Jane Austen,
by George Eliot - many famous women, and
many more unknown and forgotten, have been before me, making the path smooth,
and regulating my steps. Thus, when I came
to write, there were very few material obstacles in my way. Writing was a reputable and harmless occupation. The family peace was
not broken by the scratching of a pen. No demand was made upon the family purse.
For ten and sixpence one can buy paper enough to write all the plays of Shakespeare -
if one has a mind that way. Pianos and models, Paris, Vienna and Berlin, masters and mistresses, are not needed by a writer. The
cheapness of writing paper is, of course, the reason why women have succeeded as writers
 
 
 
 before they have succeeded in the other professions.
But to tell you my story —it is asimple one. You have only got to figure to yourselves a girl in a bedroom with a pen in her hand. She had only to move that pen from left to right - from ten o'clock to one. Then it occurred to her to do what is simple and cheap enough after all — to slip a few of those pages into an envelope, fix
a penny stamp in the corner, and drop the envelope into the red box at the corner. It was thus that I became a journalist; and my effort was rewarded on the first day of the following month —a very glorious day it was for me —by a letter from an editor containing a cheque for one pound ten shillings and sixpence. But to show you how little Ideserve to be called a professional woman, how little I know of the struggles and difficulties of such lives, I have to admit that instead of spending that sum upon bread and butter, rent, shoes and stockings, or butcher's bills, I went out and bought a cat —a beautiful cat, a Persian cat, which very soon involved me in bitter disputes with my neighbours.
What could be easier than to write articles and to buy Persian cats with the profits? But wait a moment. Articles have to be about something. Mine, I seem to remember, was about a novel by a famous man. And while I was writing this review, Idiscovered that fi Iwere going to review books I should need to do battle with a certain phantom. And the phantom was a woman, and when I came to know her better I called her after the heroine of a famous poem, The Angel in the House.' It was she who used to come between me and my paper when Iwas writing reviews.
It was she who bothered me and wasted my time and so tormented me that at last I killed her. You

who come of a younger and happier generation may not have heard of her —you may not know what Imean by the Angel in the House. Iwil describe her as shortly as I can. She was intensely sympathetic. She was immensely charming.
She was utterly unselfish. She excelled ni the difficult arts of family life. She sacrificed herself daily. fI there was chicken, she took the leg;
fi there was a draught she sat ni ti —ni short she was so constituted that she never had a
mind or a wish of her own, but preferred to sympathize always with the minds and wishes of others. Above al —Ineed not say ti —she was pure. Her purity was supposed to be her chief beauty —her blushes, her great grace. In those days —the last of Queen Victoria - every house had its Angel. And when I came ot write I encountered her with the very first words. The shadow of her wings fel on my page; Iheard the rustling of her skirts ni the room. Directly,
that si to say, Itook my pen ni my hand ot review that novel by a famous man, she slipped behind me and whispered: "My dear, you are
a young woman. You are writing about a book that has been written by a man. Be sympathetic; be tender; flatter; deceive; use all the arts and wiles of our sex. Never let anybody guess that you have a mind of your own. Above al, be pure." And she made as fi to guide my pen. I now record the one act for which Itake some credit ot myself, though the credit rightly
belongs to some excellent ancestors of mine who left me a certain sum of money —shall
we say five hundred pounds a year? —so that
ti was not necessary for me ot depend solely on charm for my living. Iturned upon her
and caught her by the throat. I did my best
ot kil her. My excuse, if Iwere to be had up
in acourt of law, would be that Iacted in self-defence. Had I not killed her she would have kiled me. She would have plucked hte heart out of my writing. For, as I found, directly Iput pen to paper, you cannot review even a
novel without having a mind of your own, with- out expressing what you think to be the truth about human relations, morality, sex. And all these questions, according to the Angel of the House, cannot be dealt with freely and openly by women; they must charm, they must conciliate, they must —to put ti bluntly —tell lies fi they are to succeed. Thus, whenever Ifelt the shadow of her wing or the radiance of her halo upon my page, Itook up the inkpot and flung it at her. She died hard. Her fictitious nature was of great assistance to her. tI is far harder to kill a phantom than a reality. She was always creeping back when I thought I had des- patched her. Though I flatter myself that I killed her in the end, the struggle was severe; ti took much time that had better have been spent upon learning Greek grammar; or in roaming the world in search of adventures. But it was a real experience; it was an experience that was found to befall all women writers at that time. Killing the Angel in the House was part of the occupation of a woman writer.
But to continue my story. The Angel was dead; what then remained? You may say that what remained was a simple and common object - a young woman in a bedroom with an inkpot. In other words, now that she had rid her- self of falsehood, that young woman had only to be herself. Ah, but what is "herself"? Imean, what is a woman? Iassure you, Ido not know. Ido not believe that you know. Ido not believe that anybody can know until she has expressed herself in al the arts and professions open to human skill. That indeed is one of the reasons why Ihave come here - out of respect for you, who are in process of showing us by your experi- ments what a woman is, who are in process of providing us, by your failures and successes, with that extremely important piece of information.
But to continue the story of my professional
experiences. I made one pound ten and six by my first review; and I bought a Persian cat with
the proceeds. Then I grew ambitious. A Persian cat is all very well, Isaid; but a Persian cat is notenough. I must have a motor car. And it was thus
that Ibecame a novelist —for it is a very strange
thing that people will give you a motor car fi you
will tell them a story. It is a still stranger thing
that there is nothing so delightful in the world as
telling stories. It is far pleasanter than writing
reviews of famous novels. And yet, fi Iam to
obey your secretary and tell you my professional
experiences as a novelist, I must tell you about a
very strange experience that befell me as a nov- elist. And to understand ti you must try first to
imagine a novelist's state of mind. Ihope Iam
not giving away professional secrets fi I say that a novelist's chief desire is to be as unconscious as possible. He has to induce in himself a state of perpetual lethargy. He wants life to proceed with the utmost quiet and regularity. He wants to see the same faces, to read the same books, to do the same things day after day, month after month, while he is writing, so that nothing may break
the illusion in which he is living —so that noth- ing may disturb or disquiet the mysterious nos- ings about, feelings round, darts, dashes and sudden discoveries of that very shy and illusive spirit, the imagination. I suspect that this state is the same both for men and women. Be that as it may, I want you to imagine me writing a novel in a state of trance. I want you to figure to your- selves a girl sitting with a pen in her hand, which for minutes, and indeed for hours, she never dips into the inkpot. The image that comes to
my mind when I think of this girl is the image of a fisherman lying sunk in dreams on the verge of a deep lake with a rod held out over the water. She was letting her imagination sweep unchecked round every rock and cranny of the world that lies submerged in the depths of our unconscious being. Now came the experience, the experience that Ibelieve to be far commoner with women writers than with men. The line raced through the girl's fingers. Her imagination had rushed away. It had sought the pools, the
depths, the dark places where the largest fish slumber. And then there was a smash. There was
an explosion. There was foam and confusion. The
imagination had dashed itself against something hard. The girl was roused from her dream. She was indeed in a state of the most acute and diffi-
cult distress. To speak without figure she had thought of something, something about the body,
about the passions which ti was unfitting for her as a woman to say. Men, her reason told her,
would be shocked. The consciousness of what men will say of a woman who speaks the truth
about her passions had roused her from her art- ist's state of unconsciousness. She could write no more. The trance was over. Her imagination could work no longer. This I believe to be a very com- mon experience with women writers —they are
impeded by the extreme conventionality of the
other sex. For though men sensibly alow them-
selves great freedom ni these respects, Idoubt that they realize or can control the extreme sever-
ity with which they condemn such freedom in w o m e n .
These then were two very genuine experi- ences of my own. These were two of the adven- tures of my professional life. The first - killing the Angel in the House —I think I solved. She
died. But the second, telling the truth about my own experiences as a body, Ido not think I
solved. I doubt that any woman has solved it yet. The obstacles against her are still immensely powerful —and yet they are very difficult to define. Outwardly, what is simpler than to write books? Outwardly, what obstacles are there for a woman rather than for a man? Inwardly, I think, the case is very different; she has still many ghosts to fight, many prejudices to overcome. Indeed it wil be along time still, Ithink, before a woman can sit down to write a book without
finding aphantom to be slain, arock to be dashed against. And fi this is so in literature, the freest of al professions for women, how si ti ni the new professions which you are now for the first time entering?
Those are the questions that Ishould like, had I time, to ask you. And indeed, if I have laid
stress upon these professional experiences of mine, it is because I believe that they are, though in different forms, yours also. Even when the path is nominally open —when there is nothing to prevent a woman from being a doctor, a lawyer, a civil servant —there are many phantoms and obstacles, as Ibelieve, looming in her way. To discuss and define them is I think of great value and importance; for thus only can the labour be shared, the difficul- ties be solved. But besides this, it is necessary
also to discuss the ends and the aims for which
we are fighting, for which we are doing battle with these formidable obstacles. Those aims
cannot be taken for granted; they must be perpetually questioned and examined. The whole position, as Ise ti —here ni this hal surrounded by women practising for the first time ni history Iknow not how many different professions —is one of extraordinary interest
>
and importance. You have won rooms of your own in the house hitherto exclusively owned by men. You are able, though not without great labour and effort, to pay the rent. You are earning your five hundred pounds a year. But this freedom si only a beginning; the room is your own, but it is still bare. It has to be fur- nished; it has to be decorated; it has to be shared. How are you going to furnish it, how are you going to decorate it? With whom are you going to share it, and upon what terms?
These, I think, are questions of the utmost importance and interest. For the first time
in history you are able to ask them; for the first time vou are able to decide for yourselves what the answers should be. Willingly would Istay and discuss those questions and
answers —but not tonight. My time is up; and I must cease.


**5. Identify an example of each of the following from the opening paragraph and explain its effect: understatement, parallel structure, rhetorical question, and irony.

  

6. What is the effect of the personal anecdote in paragraph 2? Does it appeal mainly to logos or pathos? Why is it especially effective for Woolf's audience?

7. What is Woolf's overall tone in the speech? Because the tone evolves and shifts throughout the text, determining the overall tone is complex. Identify passages where Woolf displays various tones, sometimes in order to assume a specific persona, and then develop a description of the overall tone. You will probably need to use two words (possibly joined by but or yet) or a phrase rather than a single word. Does Woolf display anger, bitterness, resignation, apology, or combativeness? or does she show a combination of these emotions or others? 

Composition

8. Imagine you have been invited to deliver a speech entitled "Professions for Women" to an audience of your peers of all genders. Cite Woolf to support your speech's thesis or propose a counterargument to Woolf's position. Your speech need only be a few paragraphs.**

Okay, let's break down this analysis of Virginia Woolf's "Professions for Women."

**5. Rhetorical Devices in the Opening Paragraph**

*   **Understatement:** "It is difficult to say. My profession is literature; and in that profession there are fewer experiences for women than in any other, with the exception of the stage - fewer, I mean, that are peculiar to women."  This downplays the challenges faced by women in literature.  The effect is to draw the audience in, piquing their curiosity about what these "fewer experiences" might be and why they exist.  It also creates a sense of shared understanding, implying that the audience already knows something about these difficulties.

*   **Parallel Structure:** "by Fanny Burney, by Aphra Behn, by Harriet Martineau, by Jane Austen, by George Eliot..."  The repetition of "by" emphasizes the lineage of women writers who paved the way.  It creates a sense of historical continuity and reinforces the idea that the speaker stands on the shoulders of these predecessors.

*   **Rhetorical Question:** "...but what professional experiences have I had?" This isn't a genuine question seeking an answer. It's a way to introduce the topic and challenge the audience's assumptions about what constitutes a "professional experience" for a woman writer. It invites the audience to consider the nuances and complexities of her position.

*   **Irony:** The entire discussion of writing being a "reputable and harmless occupation" because "For ten and sixpence one can buy paper enough to write all the plays of Shakespeare" is dripping with irony.  It's ironic because while the *material* cost of writing is low, the *social* and *psychological* costs for women writers (as she goes on to explain) are incredibly high.  It highlights the disparity between the perceived ease of writing and the real obstacles women face.

**6. Effect of the Personal Anecdote in Paragraph 2**

The personal anecdote about buying a Persian cat with her first earnings is highly effective.

*   **Pathos:** It primarily appeals to pathos. It's a charming, relatable story that humanizes the speaker and makes her seem less intimidating and more like "one of them."  It evokes a sense of warmth and perhaps even amusement. The image of a young writer indulging in a frivolous purchase rather than practical necessities is endearing and relatable.

*   **Why it's effective for Woolf's audience:**  It's effective because it subverts expectations. The audience likely expects a serious, perhaps even somber, account of professional struggles. The cat story is a lighthearted contrast that makes the subsequent discussion of more serious issues more impactful.  It also establishes a connection with the audience, suggesting that Woolf understands their experiences and is not simply lecturing them from a position of superiority. It also could be seen as a subtle commentary on the societal expectations placed on women to be frivolous and focused on domestic concerns.

**7. Woolf's Overall Tone**

Woolf's overall tone is a complex blend of **earnestness and ironic detachment.** She is deeply serious about the issues she raises, yet she maintains a certain distance through wit, self-deprecation, and a subtle sense of irony.

*   **Examples of shifting tones:**

    *   **Humble/Self-Deprecating:** The opening paragraphs, with the rhetorical questions and the cat anecdote, create a persona of someone who is down-to-earth and perhaps even slightly apologetic for her own lack of "professional" experience.
    *   **Direct/Assertive:** When she describes killing the Angel in the House, her tone becomes more direct and assertive. She is making a strong statement about the need for women to reject societal expectations.
    *   **Reflective/Inquisitive:**  The ending of the speech, with its questions about the future, is more reflective and inquisitive. She is inviting the audience to join her in a process of exploration and discovery.
    *   **Ironic/Critical:**  Her descriptions of societal expectations, especially regarding women's sexuality and intellectual freedom, are often tinged with irony. This allows her to critique these expectations without being overly confrontational.

*   **Why "earnestness and ironic detachment":** She is genuinely concerned about the obstacles facing women. However, she avoids being overly sentimental or preachy by using irony and wit to create a sense of distance and perspective. This allows her to engage the audience in a more nuanced and thought-provoking way. She is not bitter or resigned, but she is certainly aware of the ongoing battle and the need for continued vigilance. She also isn't apologetic or combative, but rather thoughtful and hopeful.

**8. Speech to Peers: "Professions for Women"**

Good morning, everyone. I'm honored to be here today to discuss "Professions for Women" with all of you.  When I first considered this topic, I immediately thought of Virginia Woolf's powerful speech, delivered nearly a century ago. While much has changed since Woolf's time, her words still resonate deeply, and I believe they offer valuable insights into the challenges we continue to face, even as we enter professions once dominated by men.

Woolf spoke of the "Angel in the House," that internalized ideal of womanhood that demanded self-sacrifice, purity, and the suppression of one's own intellect and desires. She argued that killing this phantom was a necessary step for women to achieve true creative and professional freedom. I believe this "Angel" still exists today, though perhaps in different forms. It's the pressure to be "likable," to avoid being seen as "aggressive," to prioritize family over career, or to conform to gender stereotypes in our chosen fields.

However, I would also like to propose a counterargument to Woolf's position. While I agree that it is important to challenge and overcome the obstacles that women face in the workplace, I also believe that it is important to celebrate the unique strengths and perspectives that women bring to their professions. Instead of simply trying to "kill" the Angel, perhaps we should try to redefine her. Perhaps we can find a way to be both successful professionals and compassionate, caring individuals. Perhaps we can find a way to embrace our femininity without sacrificing our ambition.

Ultimately, the goal is not simply to break down barriers, but to create a more equitable and inclusive world where everyone can thrive. We must continue to support each other, to challenge the status quo, and to create a world where all voices are heard. Thank you.
