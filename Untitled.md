| 1       | "Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green star, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock." (21)                                                                           | The American Dream/Green Light   | Gatsby's reaching for the green light at the end of Daisy's dock symbolizes his yearning for an unattainable past and the illusion of the American Dream. It represents his desire for wealth and status to win Daisy back.                                  |
| 2       | "The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room." (34)                                                         | Color/Parties                    | The vibrant color imagery contrasts sharply with the shallow, artificial nature of the party scene, highlighting the superficiality of the Roaring Twenties.                                                                                                 |
| 3       | "And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy." (49)                                                                                                                                     | Parties                          | This paradoxical statement reveals the ironic detachment and anonymity within the extravagant, bustling parties Gatsby throws.  While seemingly social, they are spaces of isolation.                                                                        |
| 3       | "If you want anything just ask for it, old sport.'" (47)                                                                                                                                                                            | The American Dream               | Gatsby's constant use of "old sport" and his lavish displays of wealth are attempts to project an image of success, embodying a superficial version of the American Dream.                                                                                   |
| 4       | "He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. 'I’ve got to telephone,' he said." (67)                                                                                                         | Clocks/The American Dream        | Gatsby's preoccupation with time symbolizes his attempt to recapture the past. He believes that wealth can buy him back the time he lost with Daisy, a flawed aspect of his pursuit of the American Dream.                                                   |
| 5       | "The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea." (89)                                                                                   | Rain/Color                       | The rain during Gatsby and Daisy's reunion symbolizes the awkwardness and tension of their initial meeting. The clearing sky and the appearance of color suggest a renewed hope for their relationship.                                                      |
| 5       | "'I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.'" (92)                                                                                       | The American Dream               | Gatsby's extravagant consumption, like having clothes shipped from England, further reinforces his constructed persona of wealth and success, key elements of his distorted American Dream.                                                                  |
| 7       | "The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer." (114)                                                                                                                                           | Symbolism/Rain (implied absence) | The oppressive heat mirrors the rising tensions and emotional climax of the story, foreshadowing the tragic events to come. The absence of rain contrasts with the earlier scenes with Daisy, emphasizing the deterioration of their rekindled relationship. |
| 7       | "’I’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end.'" (162)                                                                                        | The American Dream/Parties       | Nick's final judgment of Gatsby underscores the ultimately empty and tragic nature of Gatsby's pursuit. Despite the parties and the facade of success, Gatsby fails to achieve genuine happiness or connection.                                              |
| 9       | "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning—" (180) | ,o                               | This closing passage emphasizes the elusive nature of the American Dream.  The green light symbolizes the perpetual hope for a better future, even though it remains just out of reach.  The future Gatsby envisioned was ultimately an illusion.            |
