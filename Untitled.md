Subject: Checking In - Transcript & Email Address

Hi Coach Matt,

Just wanted to quickly check in and see if you've received my transcript yet. I understand you're probably very busy, but I also wanted to confirm I'm sending emails to the correct address for you.

Thanks for your time!

Best,

Carson West
