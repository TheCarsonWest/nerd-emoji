# Berlin Conference
*   **Imperialism:** The core driving force.
*   **Colonialism:** The direct result of the conference.
*   **Geopolitics:**  The conference was a prime example of power politics.
*   **Arbitrary Boundaries:**  The most significant and lasting negative impact.
*   **Scramble for Africa:**  The intense competition for African territory.

**Rundown:**

**1. What Happened:**

*   **Purpose:** Officially, the Berlin Conference aimed to regulate European colonization and trade in Africa during the New Imperialism period. In reality, it was a meeting to peacefully divide Africa among European powers, preventing war between them.
*   **Process:**  From November 1884 to February 1885, representatives from 14 European states (and the United States, although it didn't ratify the treaty) met in Berlin, Germany, under the invitation of Otto von Bismarck, the Chancellor of Germany.
*   **Outcome:** The conference established rules for claiming African territory.  The principle of "effective occupation" was key: a European power had to demonstrate control over an area to claim it, including having a treaty with a local leader, flying their flag, and establishing an administration. This triggered a rush by European powers to secure treaties and establish control.
*   **No African Representation:**  Critically, no African rulers or representatives were invited or consulted during the conference.  The continent was carved up with complete disregard for existing political, cultural, and ethnic boundaries.

**2. Groups and People Involved:**

*   **Major European Powers:**
    *   **Great Britain:** Sought to secure a Cape-to-Cairo route and control key strategic areas.
    *   **France:** Aimed for control of West Africa and a trans-Saharan empire.
    *   **Germany:**  A relatively latecomer to the colonial game, sought to establish its presence and prestige.
    *   **Belgium:**  King Leopold II personally controlled the Congo Free State, a vast and brutally exploited territory.
    *   **Portugal:**  Sought to consolidate its existing coastal colonies in Angola and Mozambique.
    *   **Italy:**  Attempted to gain territories, but met with limited success.
    *   **Spain:**  Held onto small territories.
*   **Key Individuals:**
    *   **Otto von Bismarck (Germany):**  Hosted the conference and sought to maintain peace among European powers while expanding German influence.
    *   **King Leopold II (Belgium):**  Played a significant role in the conference and gained control of the Congo Free State.
*   **African Populations:**  The most affected group, but completely excluded from the decision-making process.  Existing empires, kingdoms, and tribal structures were ignored.

**3. Lasting Impact on the World:**

*   **Arbitrary Boundaries:**  The most significant and enduring legacy.  European powers drew borders with no regard for existing ethnic, linguistic, or cultural groups. This led to:
    *   **Internal Conflict:**  Many African nations inherited borders that forced disparate groups to live together, leading to civil wars, ethnic tensions, and political instability after independence.
    *   **Weakened States:**  These artificial boundaries often hampered the development of strong, unified national identities.
*   **Economic Exploitation:**  The conference facilitated the extraction of resources from Africa, benefiting European economies while hindering African development.  Colonial economies were structured to serve the needs of the colonizers.
*   **Political Instability:**  The legacy of colonialism continues to affect African politics. Weak institutions, corruption, and a lack of democratic traditions are often linked to the colonial past.
*   **Neocolonialism:** Even after independence, many African nations remain economically dependent on former colonial powers and other developed countries.  This is often achieved through trade agreements, debt, and political influence.
*   **Geopolitical Implications:** The Berlin Conference set a precedent for international agreements that prioritized the interests of powerful nations over the rights and self-determination of others. This legacy continues to shape global power dynamics.
*   **Population Distribution:** The arbitrary borders caused mass migrations as people tried to live with their ethnic group.
*   **Cultural Impacts:**  The introduction of European languages, education systems, and religions had a profound and lasting impact on African cultures.

**AP Human Geography Connections:**

*   **Political Geography:**  The Berlin Conference is a prime example of how political decisions can create artificial boundaries and lead to conflict. It illustrates the concept of *state morphology* and how shapes and boundaries impact a state's functionality.
*   **Economic Geography:**  The conference highlights the economic motivations behind imperialism and the unequal distribution of resources that resulted from colonialism.  It demonstrates core-periphery relationships and dependency theory.
*   **Cultural Geography:**  The conference illustrates the imposition of European culture on African societies and the resulting cultural changes and conflicts.
*   **Development Geography:**  The conference is a key factor in understanding the underdevelopment of many African nations.  It shows how colonial policies hindered economic growth and created lasting inequalities.
*   **Population Geography:** The conference led to the forced migration of thousands of Africans.
*   **Urban Geography:** Colonial cities often were designed to extract resources from other parts of the country. This led to uneven development.
