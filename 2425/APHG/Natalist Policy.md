## China
**1. The One-Child Policy (1979-2016):** 
* **Rationale:**  Control population growth and alleviate resource strain.
	* tax people with two children more
* **Impact:**  Dramatic population decline, ==skewed gender ratio==, 
* People just aborted women because they need boys to work the farm
**2. The Two-Child Policy (2016-2021):**
* **Rationale:**  Reverse declining birth rates and maintain a stable population.
* **Impact:**  Limited success, with birth rates continuing to fall.
* **Challenges:**  High cost of living, childcare, and education, coupled with cultural shifts towards smaller families.
* People just kept aborting women
**3. The Three-Child Policy (2021-Present):**
* **Rationale:**  A more aggressive attempt to boost birth rates and address the aging population crisis.
* **Impact:**  Still too early to assess long-term effects. Some initial signs of a slight uptick in births, but the policy faces similar challenges as the two-child policy.
* **Additional Measures:**  Financial incentives, extended maternity leave, and improved childcare support.
