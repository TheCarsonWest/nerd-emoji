** [[Graduated Symbols]]**

- **Definition:** A type of thematic map where the size of the symbol representing each data point is proportional to the value of the data.
- **Purpose:** To show variations in the magnitude of a variable across geographic space.
- **Characteristics:**
 - Symbols are typically circles, squares, or triangles.
 - The size of the symbol is determined by a graduated scale, which assigns different sizes to different ranges of data values.
 - The legend shows the correspondence between symbol size and data value.
- **Advantages:**
 - Easy to understand and interpret.
 - Can effectively show large amounts of data.
 - Can be used to compare data values across different geographic areas.
- **Disadvantages:**
 - Can be difficult to create accurate graduated scales, especially when data values vary greatly.
 - Symbol overlap can occur in areas with high data values.
 - May not be suitable for representing data that is distributed unevenly across the map.
