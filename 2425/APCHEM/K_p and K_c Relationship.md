# [[Equilibrium Constant Calculations]]
# Kp and Kc Relationship

The relationship between $K_p$ (the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures) and $K_c$ (the equilibrium constant in terms of concentrations) is given by:

## $$K_p = K_c(RT)^{\Delta n}$$

where:

* $K_p$ is the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of partial pressures.
* $K_c$ is the equilibrium constant expressed in terms of molar concentrations.
* $R$ is the ideal gas constant ($0.0821 \frac{L \cdot atm}{mol \cdot K}$).
* $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.
* $\Delta n$ is the change in the number of moles of gas in the balanced chemical equation (moles of gaseous products - moles of gaseous reactants).


**Important Considerations:**

* This equation only applies to reactions involving gases.
*  $\Delta n$ only considers gaseous species.  Liquids and solids are excluded.
* Units are crucial:  Ensure consistent units throughout the calculation.


**Examples:**

* **For a reaction where $\Delta n = 0$**: $K_p = K_c$.  The equilibrium constants are numerically equal.

* **For a reaction where $\Delta n > 0$**: $K_p > K_c$.  More gaseous products than reactants.

* **For a reaction where $\Delta n < 0$**: $K_p < K_c$. More gaseous reactants than products.
