- The energy change from when an atom gains an electron to form a negative ion
- Can be **[[Exothermic]] or [[Endothermic]]**
	- Metals
		- Easier to lose than gain
		- Usually [[Endothermic]], or slightly [[Exothermic]]
	- Nonmetals
		- Easier to gain electrons
			- Adding electrons is [[Exothermic]], affinity is negative because it releases energy
