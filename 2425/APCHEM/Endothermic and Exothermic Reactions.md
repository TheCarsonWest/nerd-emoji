# [[Le Chateliers Principle]]
# [[Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions]]

**Definition:**

* **Endothermic Reactions:** Reactions that absorb heat from their surroundings.  The system's energy increases, and the surroundings' energy decreases.  $\Delta H > 0$ (positive enthalpy change).

* **Exothermic Reactions:** Reactions that release heat to their surroundings. The system's energy decreases, and the surroundings' energy increases. $\Delta H < 0$ (negative enthalpy change).


**Energy Diagrams:**

* **Endothermic:**  Reactants are at a lower energy level than products.  The activation energy ($E_a$) is the energy required to reach the transition state. ## $$ \text{Reactants} \longrightarrow \text{Transition State} \longrightarrow \text{Products} $$

* **Exothermic:** Products are at a lower energy level than reactants. The activation energy ($E_a$) is still the energy required to reach the transition state. ## $$ \text{Reactants} \longrightarrow \text{Transition State} \longrightarrow \text{Products} $$

**Examples:**

* **Endothermic:** Melting ice ($H_2O(s) \rightarrow H_2O(l)$), photosynthesis.
* **Exothermic:** Combustion of methane ($CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(l)$), neutralization reactions.


**Relationship to [[Enthalpy]]:**

[[Enthalpy ($H$) is a state function representing the heat content of a system at constant pressure.  The change in enthalpy ($\Delta H$) is the difference between the enthalpy of the products and the enthalpy of the reactants:  $\Delta H = H_{products} - H_{reactants}$.  Enthalpy]]

**Relationship to [[Entropy:** Entropy]]

**Factors Affecting Reaction Rate:**  [[Reaction Kinetics]]  These factors (temperature, concentration, surface area, catalysts) affect *how quickly* a reaction reaches equilibrium, but do not change whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic.

**[[Calorimetry:**  Calorimetry]]  This is a technique used to measure the heat changes in reactions, allowing us to determine whether a reaction is endothermic or exothermic and to quantify the amount of heat transferred.


**Spontaneity:**  [[Gibbs Free Energy]]  Whether a reaction will occur spontaneously depends not only on enthalpy but also on entropy and temperature, as described by the Gibbs Free Energy equation.
