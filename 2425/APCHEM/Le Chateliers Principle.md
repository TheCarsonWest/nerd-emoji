# [[Le Chateliers Principle]] Notes

[[Le Chateliers Principle]] states that if a change of condition is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system will shift in a direction that relieves the stress.  This applies to changes in concentration, pressure, volume, and temperature.

**Types of Stress and System Response:**

* **Change in Concentration:**
    * Increasing the concentration of a reactant shifts the equilibrium to the right (towards products).
    * Increasing the concentration of a product shifts the equilibrium to the left (towards reactants).
    * Decreasing the concentration of a reactant shifts the equilibrium to the left.
    * Decreasing the concentration of a product shifts the equilibrium to the right.

* **Change in Pressure/Volume (for gaseous systems):**
    * Increasing pressure (or decreasing volume) favors the side with fewer moles of gas.
    * Decreasing pressure (or increasing volume) favors the side with more moles of gas.  
    * If the number of moles of gas is the same on both sides, a change in pressure/volume has no effect.

* **Change in Temperature:**
    * This is more complex and depends on whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic.
        * **Exothermic Reaction ($ \Delta H < 0 $):**  Increasing temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left (towards reactants); decreasing temperature shifts it to the right (towards products).  Heat is treated as a product.
        * **Endothermic Reaction ($ \Delta H > 0 $):** Increasing temperature shifts the equilibrium to the right; decreasing temperature shifts it to the left. Heat is treated as a reactant.

**Mathematical Representation (using $K_{eq}$):**

The equilibrium constant, $K_{eq}$, remains constant at a given temperature.  Changes in concentration, pressure, or volume will cause a shift in equilibrium, but $K_{eq}$ itself will not change unless the temperature changes.


**Examples:**

* Consider the reaction:  $N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g)$  (This is an exothermic reaction)
    * Increasing the concentration of $N_2$ will shift the equilibrium to the right.
    * Increasing the pressure will shift the equilibrium to the right (fewer moles of gas on the product side).
    * Increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium to the left (favoring reactants as heat is a product).
