# [[AP CHEM solutions]] [[Distillation]] is a separation technique used to purify liquids based on differences in their boiling points.  It leverages the fact that in a mixture, each component will exert its own [[vapor pressure]], and the more volatile component (the one with the lower boiling point) will have a higher [[vapor pressure]].

## Basic Principles

* **[[vapor pressure]]:** [[vapor pressure]]  The pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases (liquid or solid) at a given temperature in a closed system.
* **Boiling Point:** The temperature at which the [[vapor pressure]] of a liquid equals the external pressure surrounding the liquid.
* **[[partial pressure]]:**  In a mixture of gases, each gas exerts its own [[partial pressure]].  The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all the gases present.  
* **[[Raoults Law]]:**  [[Raoults Law]] For an ideal solution, the [[partial pressure]] of each component is equal to the product of the pure component's [[vapor pressure]] and its mole fraction in the liquid mixture.  Mathematically:

### $$P_A = x_A P_A^*$$

where:

* $P_A$ is the [[partial pressure]] of component A
* $x_A$ is the mole fraction of component A in the liquid phase
* $P_A^*$ is the [[vapor pressure]] of pure component A

## Simple [[Distillation]] 
Simple distillation is effective for separating liquids with significantly different boiling points (generally a difference of at least 25Â°C).  The mixture is heated, and the more volatile component vaporizes first.  The vapor is then cooled and condensed back into a liquid, which is collected separately.

## Fractional [[Distillation]] 
Fractional distillation is used to separate liquids with closer boiling points.  It employs a fractionating column, which provides a large surface area for multiple condensation and vaporization cycles. As the vapor rises through the column, it repeatedly condenses and re-vaporizes.  With each cycle, the vapor becomes richer in the more volatile component.  This process effectively creates a temperature gradient along the column, allowing for finer separation.

## Limitations of [[Distillation]] 
* **[[Azeotropes]]:** [[Azeotropes]] Some mixtures form [[Azeotropes]], which are constant boiling mixtures that cannot be separated by simple distillation.
* **[[Heat]] sensitive compounds:**  Some compounds decompose at high temperatures, making distillation unsuitable.
* **Energy intensive:** [[Distillation]] can be an energy-intensive process, especially for large-scale operations.
