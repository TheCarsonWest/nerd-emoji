# [[APCHEM Gasses]]
- [[Distillation]]


# Very simple equation

# $$P_{t}=\sum P_{n}$$
### Or for dummies:
 $$P_{t} = P_{1}+P_{2}+\ ...\ + P_{n}$$
# To find one element's [[partial pressure]]
# $$P_A = x_A P_A^*$$
where:

* $P_A$ is the [[partial pressure]] of component A
* $x_A$ is the mole fraction of component A in the liquid phase
* $P_A^*$ is the [[vapor pressure]] of pure component A
