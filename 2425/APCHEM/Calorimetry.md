# [[Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions]]
# [[Calorimetry]]

**Definition:** [[Calorimetry]] is the science of measuring the heat of chemical reactions or physical changes.  It's based on the principle of heat transfer: heat lost by one system equals heat gained by another.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Specific Heat Capacity ($c$):** The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 Kelvin).  Units are typically J/g°C or J/gK.  $q = mc\Delta T$

* **Heat Capacity ($C$):** The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of an entire object by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 Kelvin). Units are typically J/°C or J/K.  $q = C\Delta T$

* **Heat Transfer ($q$):** The amount of heat energy transferred.  It's positive if heat is absorbed (endothermic) and negative if heat is released (exothermic).

* **[[Enthalpy]] Change ($\Delta H$):**  The heat absorbed or released at constant pressure.  For reactions in solution, often measured using a calorimeter.  $\Delta H = q_p$ (where $q_p$ is heat at constant pressure).

* **Types of [[Calorimetry]]:**
    * **Constant-pressure calorimetry (coffee-cup calorimeter):**  Used for reactions at atmospheric pressure. Heat exchanged is approximately equal to the change in enthalpy ($\Delta H$).
    * **Constant-volume calorimetry (bomb calorimeter):** Used for combustion reactions.  Heat exchanged is related to the change in internal energy ($\Delta U$).  [[Bomb Calorimetry]]


**Equations:**

* **Heat transfer:** $q = mc\Delta T$  or $q = C\Delta T$
* **Relationship between heat and enthalpy change:** $\Delta H = q_p$
* **First Law of Thermodynamics:** $\Delta U = q + w$ (where $\Delta U$ is change in internal energy, $q$ is heat, and $w$ is work).  At constant volume, $w = 0$, so $\Delta U = q_v$


**Example Calculations:**

* **Calculating specific heat capacity:**  If 100 g of water absorbs 4184 J of heat and its temperature increases by 10°C, then the specific heat capacity of water is: $c = \frac{q}{m\Delta T} = \frac{4184 J}{(100 g)(10°C)} = 4.184 J/g°C$

* **Calculating heat transfer:** If 50 g of water with a specific heat capacity of 4.184 J/g°C undergoes a temperature change of 20°C, then the heat transferred is: $q = mc\Delta T = (50 g)(4.184 J/g°C)(20°C) = 4184 J$
