## Calculating Formal Charge in Chemistry

This note covers the concept of [[formal charge]] calculation in the context of organic chemistry, illustrated through various examples.

### What is Formal Charge?

Formal charge is a way to track electron distribution in a molecule to understand the stability and reactivity of atoms within the molecule.

### Formula for Calculating Formal Charge

Formal Charge = (Number of Valence Electrons in Free Atom) - (Number of Bonds + Number of Dots (Lone Pair Electrons))

### Examples

**Example 1: Oxygen in Methanol**

* **Structure:** CH<sub>3</sub>OH with oxygen having 3 lone pairs.
* **Valence Electrons:** Oxygen (Group 6A) has 6 valence electrons.
* **Bonds and Dots:** Oxygen has 1 bond and 6 dots (3 lone pairs).
* **Calculation:** 6 - (1 + 6) = -1
* **Formal Charge:** Oxygen has a [[formal charge]] of -1.

**Example 2: Carbocation**

* **Structure:** Carbon with 3 bonds.
* **Valence Electrons:** Carbon (Group 4A) has 4 valence electrons.
* **Bonds and Dots:** Carbon has 3 bonds and 0 dots.
* **Calculation:** 4 - (3 + 0) = +1
* **Formal Charge:** Carbon has a [[formal charge]] of +1 and is called a carbocation (carbon cation).

**Example 3: Bromine with a Double Bond**

* **Structure:** Bromine double bonded to carbon with 2 lone pairs on bromine.
* **Valence Electrons:** Bromine (Group 7A) has 7 valence electrons.
* **Bonds and Dots:** Bromine has 2 bonds and 4 dots (2 lone pairs).
* **Calculation:** 7 - (2 + 4) = +1
* **Formal Charge:** Bromine has a [[formal charge]] of +1.

**Example 4: Nitrogen with Four Methyl Groups**

* **Structure:** Nitrogen attached to four CH<sub>3</sub> groups.
* **Lewis Structure:** Nitrogen in the center with four single bonds to CH<sub>3</sub> groups.
* **Valence Electrons:** Nitrogen (Group 5A) has 5 valence electrons.
* **Bonds and Dots:** Nitrogen has 4 bonds and 0 dots.
* **Calculation:** 5 - (4 + 0) = +1
* **Formal Charge:** Nitrogen has a [[formal charge]] of +1.

**Example 5: Carbon in a Double Bond with a Lone Pair**

* **Structure:** CH<sub>2</sub>=CH with a lone pair on the second carbon.
* **Lewis Structure:** First carbon has 2 single bonds to hydrogen and a double bond to the second carbon. The second carbon has a single bond to hydrogen and a lone pair.
* **Valence Electrons:** Carbon (Group 4A) has 4 valence electrons.
* **Bonds and Dots:** The second carbon has 3 bonds (1 single + 1 double) and 2 dots (1 lone pair).
* **Calculation:** 4 - (3 + 2) = -1
* **Formal Charge:** The second carbon has a [[formal charge]] of -1.
