# AP Chemistry: 8.4 Acid-Base Reactions and Buffers

## I. Acid-Base Reactions

### A. Neutralization Reactions
*   Reactions between an acid and a base, typically forming a salt and water.
$$Acid + Base \rightarrow Salt + Water$$

### B. Titration [[Titration]]
*   A technique used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution (analyte) by reacting it with a solution of known concentration (titrant).
*   **Equivalence Point:** The point in a titration where the moles of acid and base are stoichiometrically equivalent.
*   **Endpoint:** The point in a titration where the indicator changes color, signaling the approximate equivalence point.

### C. Strong Acid-Strong Base Titrations
*   The pH at the equivalence point is 7.
*   The pH curve shows a sharp change around the equivalence point.

### D. Weak Acid-Strong Base Titrations
*   The pH at the equivalence point is greater than 7. The conjugate base of the weak acid hydrolyzes, producing hydroxide ions.
*   Initial pH is determined using an [[ICE Tables]] for the weak acid.
*   Halfway to the equivalence point, $pH = pK_a$ .
*   Beyond the equivalence point, the pH is determined by the excess strong base.

### E. Strong Acid-Weak Base Titrations
*   The pH at the equivalence point is less than 7. The conjugate acid of the weak base hydrolyzes, producing hydronium ions.
*   Initial pH is determined using an [[ICE Tables]] for the weak base.
*   Halfway to the equivalence point, $pOH = pK_b$ or $pH = 14 - pK_b$.
*   Beyond the equivalence point, the pH is determined by the excess strong acid.

### F. Polyprotic Acid Titrations
*   Polyprotic acids have multiple ionizable protons. Titration curves show multiple equivalence points, one for each proton. [[Polyprotic Acids]]

## II. Buffers [[Buffer Solutions]]

### A. Definition
*   A solution that resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added.
*   A buffer typically consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

### B. How Buffers Work
*   The weak acid neutralizes added base, and the conjugate base neutralizes added acid.

### C. [[Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation]]
*   Used to calculate the pH of a buffer solution.
$$pH = pK_a + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$$
    *   Where $pK_a = -logK_a$, $[A^-]$ is the concentration of the conjugate base, and $[HA]$ is the concentration of the weak acid.

### D. Buffer Capacity
*   The amount of acid or base a buffer can neutralize before the pH begins to change significantly.
*   Buffer capacity is greatest when the concentrations of the weak acid and conjugate base are equal.

### E. Preparing a Buffer
*   Choose a weak acid with a $pK_a$ close to the desired pH.
*   Adjust the ratio of $[A^-]/[HA]$ to achieve the desired pH using the [[Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation]].

### F. Effective Buffer Range
*   Buffers are most effective within $\pm 1$ pH unit of the $pK_a$ value.
