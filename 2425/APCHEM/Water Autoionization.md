# [[Equilibrium Constant Calculations]]
# [[Water Autoionization]]

Water undergoes autoionization, meaning it reacts with itself to a small extent to produce hydronium ($H_3O^+$) and hydroxide ($OH^-$) ions.

## $$K_w = [H_3O^+]][OH^-]]$$

This is the equilibrium constant expression for the autoionization of water, where $K_w$ is the ion-product constant for water.  At 25°C, $K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}$.

* **Relationship between $[H_3O^+]]$ and $[OH^-]]$:** In pure water, $[H_3O^+]] = [OH^-]] = 1.0 \times 10^{-7}$ M. This leads to a neutral solution.

* **pH and pOH:**
    * $pH = -\log_{10}[H_3O^+]]$
    * $pOH = -\log_{10}[OH^-]]$
    * $pH + pOH = 14$ (at 25°C)

* **Acidic, Basic, and Neutral Solutions:**
    * **Acidic:** $[H_3O^+]] > [OH^-]]$; $pH < 7$
    * **Basic:** $[H_3O^+]] < [OH^-]]$; $pH > 7$
    * **Neutral:** $[H_3O^+]] = [OH^-]]$; $pH = 7$

* **Effect of Temperature:** $K_w$ increases with increasing temperature. This means that at higher temperatures, the autoionization of water is more significant, and the concentration of both $H_3O^+$ and $OH^-$ ions increases.
