# [[chemical reactions]]
## Introduction

Chemical kinetics is the study of [[Reaction Rates]].  A rate law expresses the relationship between the rate of a reaction and the concentrations of reactants.  The rate law provides crucial information about the mechanism of a reaction.
# [[units of reaction constant]]
## General Form of a Rate Law

For a generic reaction:

# $$aA + bB → cC + dD$$

The rate law is expressed as:

# $$Rate = k[A]]^m[B]]^n \dots$$

Where:

*  *k* is the rate constant ([[Temperature]] dependent).
*  *[A]]* and *[B]]* are the molar concentrations of reactants A and B.
*  *m* and *[n]]* are the reaction orders with respect to A and B, respectively.  These are *not* necessarily the same as the stoichiometric coefficients (a and b).  They must be determined experimentally.


## Reaction Order

The overall reaction order is the sum of the individual orders (m + n).  The reaction order indicates how the rate changes with changes in reactant concentration:

* **Zero Order:**  The rate is independent of the reactant's concentration.  If [A]] doubles, the rate stays the same.
* **First Order:** The rate is directly proportional to the reactant's concentration. If [A]] doubles, the rate doubles.
* **Second Order:** The rate is proportional to the square of the reactant's concentration.  If [A]] doubles, the rate quadruples.

## Determining [[Rate Laws]] 
There are several methods to determine rate laws experimentally:

* **Method of Initial Rates:** [[Method of Initial Rates]] This method uses initial [[Reaction Rates]] measured under different initial reactant concentrations.  By comparing the changes in rate with changes in concentration, the reaction orders can be determined.

* **Integrated [[Rate Laws]]:** [[Integrated Rate Laws]] These laws relate concentration to time.  By plotting experimental data according to the integrated rate laws for different orders, the correct order can be identified by the linear plot.

* **Graphical Methods:**  Analyzing plots of concentration versus time can help determine the reaction order.  For example, a plot of ln[A]] vs. time yields a straight line for a first-order reaction.


## Rate Constant (k)

The rate constant, *k*, is a proportionality constant that relates the rate to the reactant concentrations.  Its value depends on:

* **[[Temperature]]:**  Generally, *k* increases with temperature.  [[Arrhenius Equation]]
* **[[Activation Energy]]:** [[Activation Energy]] A higher [[Activation Energy]] results in a smaller *k*.
* **Presence of a Catalyst:**  Catalysts increase *k* by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower [[Activation Energy]]. [[Catalysis]]
### Units of k

The units of *k* depend on the overall reaction order:

* **Zero Order:** M/s or mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹
* **First Order:** s⁻¹
* **Second Order:** M⁻¹s⁻¹ or L mol⁻¹ s⁻¹
# Example Rate Law Problem

**Problem:**

The following data were collected for the reaction:  A + B → C

| Experiment | [A]] (M) | [B]] (M) | Initial Rate (M/s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.10 | 0.10 | 1.0 x 10⁻⁴ |
| 2 | 0.20 | 0.10 | 4.0 x 10⁻⁴ |
| 3 | 0.10 | 0.20 | 2.0 x 10⁻⁴ |


Determine the rate law for this reaction, including the value of the rate constant, *k*.


**Solution:**

**1. Determine the order with respect to A:**

Compare experiments 1 and 2, where [B]] is constant but [A]] doubles:

* The rate increases by a factor of 4 (4.0 x 10⁻⁴ / 1.0 x 10⁻⁴ = 4).
* Since the rate quadruples when [A]] doubles, the reaction is second order with respect to A (2² = 4).

**2. Determine the order with respect to B:**

Compare experiments 1 and 3, where [A]] is constant but [B]] doubles:

* The rate increases by a factor of 2 (2.0 x 10⁻⁴ / 1.0 x 10⁻⁴ = 2).
* Since the rate doubles when [B]] doubles, the reaction is first order with respect to B.

**3. Write the rate law:**

The rate law is:  Rate = k[A]]²[B]]¹  or simply Rate = k[A]]²[B]]

**4. Determine the value of the rate constant, k:**

Use the data from any experiment to solve for k. Let's use experiment 1:

1.0 x 10⁻⁴ M/s = k (0.10 M)² (0.10 M)

k = (1.0 x 10⁻⁴ M/s) / (0.001 M³) = 0.1 M⁻²s⁻¹

**5. Final Answer:**

The rate law for the reaction is:  Rate = 0.1 M⁻²s⁻¹ [A]]²[B]]


# Elementary Reactions
An elementary reaction is a single step in a reaction mechanism.  For elementary reactions, the reaction orders *are* equal to the stoichiometric coefficients.  Complex reactions involve multiple elementary steps.  The slowest elementary step, called the rate-determining step, determines the overall rate law. [[Rate-Determining Step]]
