Electrolytes are substances that, when dissolved in water or other solvents, dissociate into ions and become electrically conductive.

**Properties:**

* **Electrical Conductivity:** Electrolytes conduct electricity in solution due to the presence of free ions.
* **Dissociation:** Electrolytes dissociate into ions through a process called ionization.
* **Ionic Strength:** The concentration of ions in solution affects the electrolyte's ability to conduct electricity.

**Types of Electrolytes:**

* **Strong Electrolytes:** Ionize completely in solution, producing a high concentration of ions. Examples: $NaCl$, $HCl$, $NaOH$
* **Weak Electrolytes:** Ionize only partially, producing a lower concentration of ions. Examples: $CH_3COOH$ (acetic acid), $NH_3$ (ammonia)

**Examples:**

**Strong Electrolytes:**

* Sodium chloride ($NaCl$)
* Hydrochloric acid ($HCl$)
* Sodium hydroxide ($NaOH$)
* Potassium chloride ($KCl$)
* Calcium chloride ($CaCl_2$)

**Weak Electrolytes:**

* Acetic acid ($CH_3CO(OH)$)
* Ammonia ($NH_3$)
* Carbonic acid ($H_2CO_3$)
* Phosphoric acid ($H_3PO_4$)
* Hydrofluoric acid ($HF$)

**Applications:**

* **Batteries:** Electrolytes facilitate the flow of ions between electrodes, generating an electrical current.
* **Electrolysis:** Electrolytes allow the separation of elements or compounds through an electrical current.
* **Water Purification:** Electrolytes can be used to remove impurities from water by a process called electrodialysis.
