# [[chemical reactions]]

Collision theory explains the rate of [[chemical reactions]] based on the frequency and effectiveness of collisions between reacting particles (atoms, ions, or molecules).  For a reaction to occur, reactant particles must collide with sufficient energy and proper orientation.

## 1. Collision Frequency

The rate of a reaction is directly proportional to the number of collisions per unit time between reactant particles.  Several factors influence collision frequency:

* **Concentration:** Higher concentrations of reactants lead to more frequent collisions, increasing the reaction rate.  $Rate \propto [A]][B]]$ (for a reaction between A and B).
* **[[Temperature]]:** Increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy of particles, leading to faster movement and more frequent, higher-energy collisions.
* **Surface Area:** For reactions involving solids, a larger surface area exposes more particles to collisions, increasing the reaction rate.
* [[Pressure]] (Gases: For gaseous reactions, increasing pressure increases the concentration of gas molecules, leading to more frequent collisions.

## 2. [[Activation Energy]] ($E_a$)

Even if particles collide frequently, not all collisions lead to a reaction.  A minimum amount of energy, called the [[Activation Energy]] ($E_a$), is required to break existing bonds and form new ones.  This energy is needed to overcome the energy barrier separating reactants and products.  Particles must possess at least $E_a$ in kinetic energy for a successful collision.

## 3. Orientation

Besides sufficient energy, colliding particles must also have the correct orientation.  The atoms involved in bond breaking and formation must be appropriately positioned for the reaction to proceed.  If the orientation is incorrect, even a high-energy collision will be ineffective.

## 4. The Arrhenius Equation

The Arrhenius equation quantitatively relates the rate constant ($k$) of a reaction to the [[Activation Energy]] ($E_a$), temperature ($T$), and a frequency factor ($A$):

$k = Ae^{\frac{-E_a}{RT}}$

where:

* $k$ is the rate constant
* $A$ is the frequency factor (related to the frequency and orientation of collisions)
* $E_a$ is the [[Activation Energy]]
* $R$ is the ideal gas constant (8.314 [[J]]/molÂ·K)
* $T$ is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin)


The Arrhenius equation can be linearized to determine $E_a$ experimentally:

$\ln k = \ln A - \frac{E_a}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{T}$

A plot of $\ln k$ vs. $\frac{1}{T}$ yields a straight line with a slope of $-\frac{E_a}{R}$.

## 5. Catalysts

Catalysts increase the rate of a reaction without being consumed themselves. They achieve this by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower [[Activation Energy]] ($E_a$).  This means more collisions will have sufficient energy to overcome the energy barrier, leading to a faster reaction rate.  Catalysts do *not* affect the equilibrium position of a reversible reaction, only the rate at which it is reached.
