# [[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs]]
# [[Base Strength and Conjugate Acid Strength]]

**Key Idea:**  The strength of a base is inversely related to the strength of its conjugate acid.  A strong base has a weak conjugate acid, and a weak base has a strong conjugate acid.

* **Base Strength:** Determined by how readily a base accepts a proton ($H^+$).  Strong bases completely dissociate in water, while weak bases only partially dissociate.

* **Examples of Strong Bases:** Group 1 hydroxides ($NaOH$, $KOH$), Group 2 hydroxides ($Ca(OH)_2$, $Ba(OH)_2$)  These completely dissociate in water.  $NaOH \rightarrow Na^+ + OH^-$

* **Examples of Weak Bases:** Ammonia ($NH_3$), amines (organic compounds with $NH_2$ group). These partially dissociate in water. $NH_3 + H_2O \rightleftharpoons NH_4^+ + OH^-$

* **$K_b$ ([[Base Dissociation Constant]]):**  A measure of base strength.  A larger $K_b$ value indicates a stronger base.  For the reaction $B + H_2O \rightleftharpoons BH^+ + OH^-$,  $K_b = \frac{[BH^+]][OH^-]]}{[B]]}$

* **$pK_b$: ** $pK_b = -\log{K_b}$.  A smaller $pK_b$ value indicates a stronger base.

* **Conjugate Acid Strength:** The strength of the conjugate acid is directly related to the stability of the conjugate acid.  Factors affecting stability include:
    * Resonance stabilization
    * Inductive effects
    * Size and electronegativity of the atom holding the positive charge

* **Relationship between $K_a$ and $K_b$:** For a conjugate acid-base pair in water at 25Â°C: $K_a \times K_b = K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}$

* **[[Acid Strength and Conjugate Base Strength]]**:  This is the reciprocal relationship.

* **Practice Problems:**

    1.  Compare the relative base strengths of $NH_3$ and $CH_3NH_2$.  Explain your reasoning using $pK_b$ values or other relevant concepts.
    2.  Predict the conjugate acid of $HPO_4^{2-}$ and determine whether it is a strong or weak acid. Explain.
    3.  Given that the $K_a$ of $HF$ is $7.2 \times 10^{-4}$, calculate the $K_b$ of its conjugate base, $F^-$.
