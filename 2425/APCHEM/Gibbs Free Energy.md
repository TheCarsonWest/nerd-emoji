Gibbs Free Energy ($G$) is a thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure.  It's a crucial concept for predicting the spontaneity of a reaction.

## Defining Gibbs Free Energy

Gibbs Free Energy is defined by the equation:

$G = H - TS$

where:

* $G$ is the Gibbs Free Energy (in Joules or Kilojoules)
* $H$ is the enthalpy of the system (in Joules or Kilojoules) [[Enthalpy]]
* $T$ is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin)
* $S$ is the entropy of the system (in Joules/Kelvin) [[Entropy]]


## Spontaneity and Gibbs Free Energy

The change in Gibbs Free Energy ($\Delta G$) for a process determines its spontaneity under conditions of constant temperature and pressure:

* $\Delta G < 0$: The process is spontaneous (occurs without external intervention).
* $\Delta G > 0$: The process is non-spontaneous (requires external work to occur).  The reverse process is spontaneous.
* $\Delta G = 0$: The process is at equilibrium; there is no net change in the system.

##  Relationship to Equilibrium Constant ($K$)

For a reaction at equilibrium, the change in Gibbs Free Energy is zero ($\Delta G = 0$).  The standard Gibbs Free Energy change ($\Delta G°$) is related to the equilibrium constant ($K$) by the following equation:

$\Delta G° = -RT \ln K$

where:

* $R$ is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)
* $T$ is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin)
* $K$ is the equilibrium constant

This equation allows us to calculate the equilibrium constant from the standard Gibbs Free Energy change, and vice versa.  A large positive $\Delta G°$ indicates a small $K$ (reaction favors reactants), while a large negative $\Delta G°$ indicates a large $K$ (reaction favors products).


## Standard Gibbs Free Energy Change ($\Delta G°$)

The standard Gibbs Free Energy change ($\Delta G°$) refers to the change in Gibbs Free Energy when reactants in their standard states are converted to products in their standard states at a specified temperature (usually 298 K).  Standard states are defined as: 1 atm pressure for gases, 1 M concentration for solutions, and the pure substance for solids and liquids.

$\Delta G°$ can be calculated from standard enthalpy changes ($\Delta H°$) and standard entropy changes ($\Delta S°$):

$\Delta G° = \Delta H° - T\Delta S°$

It can also be calculated from the standard Gibbs Free Energies of formation ($\Delta G°_f$) of the reactants and products:

$\Delta G°_{rxn} = \sum \Delta G°_{f,products} - \sum \Delta G°_{f,reactants}$


##  Gibbs Free Energy and Non-Standard Conditions

The equation relating $\Delta G$ to $\Delta G°$ and the reaction quotient ($Q$) is:

$\Delta G = \Delta G° + RT \ln Q$

This equation is crucial for calculating the Gibbs Free Energy change under non-standard conditions.  The reaction quotient ($Q$) has the same form as the equilibrium constant ($K$), but uses the actual concentrations or partial pressures of reactants and products at any given time, not just at equilibrium.


## [[Enthalpy]]

Enthalpy ($H$) is a measure of the total heat content of a system.  A positive change in enthalpy ($\Delta H > 0$) indicates an endothermic process (heat is absorbed), while a negative change in enthalpy ($\Delta H < 0$) indicates an exothermic process (heat is released).


## [[Entropy]]

Entropy ($S$) is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system.  A positive change in entropy ($\Delta S > 0$) indicates an increase in disorder, while a negative change in entropy ($\Delta S < 0$) indicates a decrease in disorder.
