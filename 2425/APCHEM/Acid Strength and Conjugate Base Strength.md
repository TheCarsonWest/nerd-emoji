# [[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs]]
# [[Acid Strength and Conjugate Base Strength]]

**Main Idea:**  The strength of an acid is inversely related to the strength of its conjugate base.  Strong acids have weak conjugate bases, and weak acids have strong conjugate bases.

* **[[Acid Dissociation Constant]] ($K_a$)**: This equilibrium constant quantifies the strength of an acid in aqueous solution.  A larger $K_a$ value indicates a stronger acid.

  $HA(aq) \rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + A^-(aq)$

  $K_a = \frac{[H^+]][A^-]]}{[HA]]}$

* **pKa:** The negative logarithm of $K_a$.  A smaller $pK_a$ value indicates a stronger acid.  $pK_a = -\log_{10}K_a$

* **Factors Affecting Acid Strength:**

    * **Bond Strength:** Weaker bonds are easier to break, leading to stronger acids.  Consider the H-X bond strength in hydrohalic acids (HF, HCl, HBr, HI). [[Bond Strength and Acid Strength]]
    * **Electronegativity:**  More electronegative atoms stabilize the conjugate base by attracting the negative charge more effectively. This makes the acid stronger. [[Electronegativity and Acid Strength]]
    * **Resonance:** If the conjugate base can delocalize the negative charge through resonance, the acid will be stronger. [[Resonance and Acid Strength]]
    * **Size/Polarizability:** Larger atoms can better stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base through polarizability, leading to stronger acidity. [[Atomic Size and Acid Strength]]
    * **Inductive Effect:** Electron-withdrawing groups can stabilize the conjugate base and increase acid strength.  [[Inductive Effect and Acid Strength]]


* **Conjugate Base Strength:** The strength of a conjugate base is directly related to the stability of the anion ($A^-$).  Factors that stabilize the anion ($A^-$) make it a weaker conjugate base and, therefore, the corresponding acid stronger.


* **Relationship between $K_a$ and $K_b$**:  For a conjugate acid-base pair, the product of their dissociation constants equals the ion product of water ($K_w$).

  $K_a \times K_b = K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}$ at 25Â°C

* **Examples:**

    * HCl (strong acid) has a very weak conjugate base, $Cl^-$.
    * $CH_3COOH$ (weak acid) has a relatively strong conjugate base, $CH_3COO^-$.
