## ID: [[GI Bill]] (Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944)

## WHEN: June 22, 1944

## WHO:
*   U.S. Federal Government; Signed into law by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] *   Specifically aimed at assisting WWII veterans returning home

## WHAT:
The [[GI Bill]] was a law that provided a range of benefits to returning World War II veterans. These benefits included:
    *   Low-cost mortgages
    *   Low-interest loans to start a business
    *   Cash payments of tuition and living expenses to attend university, high school, or vocational/technical school
    *   One year of unemployment compensation

## IMPACT: Why Significant?:
*   **Education Boom:** Enabled millions of veterans to attend college, leading to a more educated workforce and driving economic growth.
*   **Homeownership Increase:** Facilitated a significant increase in homeownership among veterans, contributing to the growth of suburbs and the American middle class.
*   **Economic Expansion:** Fueled economic prosperity in the postwar era by stimulating demand for goods and services.
*   **Social Mobility:** Provided opportunities for veterans from diverse backgrounds to achieve upward social mobility.
*   **Impact on Minorities:** Although the [[GI Bill]] benefited many, discriminatory practices at the local level often limited the access of African American veterans to the full range of benefits, particularly in housing. This exacerbated existing inequalities. The bill's impact was transformative overall, but its unequal application highlighted ongoing issues of racial discrimination in the US.
*   **Long-Term Legacy:** Shaped the landscape of American society by creating a more educated, prosperous, and suburbanized nation. Served as a model for future government programs aimed at assisting veterans.
