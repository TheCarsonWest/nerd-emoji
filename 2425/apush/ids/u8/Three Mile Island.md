*   **Stricter Regulations:** Led to significant changes in NRC regulations and oversight, including increased safety measures, improved operator training, and emergency planning requirements.
*   **Decline in Nuclear Power:**  Significantly hampered the growth of the nuclear power industry in the US; no new nuclear power plants were commissioned for decades following the accident. Many planned reactors were cancelled.
*   **Environmental Movement:** Strengthened the environmental movement, highlighting the potential dangers of industrial accidents and the need for greater environmental protection.
*   **Emergency Response Planning:** Showed the inadequacy of existing emergency response plans and led to better preparedness and coordination among federal, state, and local agencies.
