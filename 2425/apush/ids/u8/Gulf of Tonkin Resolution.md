## ID: [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] 
## When: August 7, 1964

## Who:
* **US Congress:**  Approved the resolution.
* **President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (LBJ):** Sought and used the resolution as justification for escalating US involvement in Vietnam.
* **North Vietnam:** Allegedly attacked US ships in the Gulf of Tonkin.

## What:
A joint resolution passed by the US Congress in response to alleged attacks on US Navy ships (USS Maddox and USS Turner Joy) in the Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of North Vietnam. The resolution authorized President Johnson to take "all necessary measures" to repel any armed attack against US forces and to prevent further aggression in Southeast Asia.  The validity of the attacks remains debated.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Escalation of the Vietnam War:**  The resolution provided President Johnson with a "blank check" to expand US military involvement in Vietnam without a formal declaration of war.
* **Increased US Troop Deployment:** Led to a massive increase in US troop presence in Vietnam, from a few thousand advisors to over 500,000 troops by 1968.
* **Erosion of Public Support:** As the war escalated and casualties mounted, public support for the war declined, leading to anti-war protests and growing distrust of the government.
* **Congressional Backlash:**  Later, Congress sought to limit presidential power with the War Powers Act of 1973, requiring presidential consultation with Congress before deploying troops in a prolonged conflict.
* **Controversy and Debate:** The Gulf of Tonkin incident and the subsequent resolution remain controversial, with questions raised about the accuracy of the information presented to Congress and the motivations behind the escalation of the war.
