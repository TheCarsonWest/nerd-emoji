## What:

A political and social protest campaign against the policy of racial segregation on the public transit system of Montgomery, Alabama.

African Americans boycotted the city buses by walking, carpooling, and finding alternative transportation.

* **Rise of MLK:** It catapulted Martin Luther King Jr. into a position of national leadership in the Civil Rights Movement, showcasing his powerful oratory and nonviolent resistance strategies.
* **Model for Future Protests:** It demonstrated the effectiveness of nonviolent direct action and served as a blueprint for future Civil Rights protests, such as sit-ins and freedom rides.
* **Economic Impact:** The bus company suffered significant financial losses, highlighting the economic power of organized boycotts.
* **Inspired National Movement:** It galvanized the African American community and strengthened the resolve to fight for equal rights, contributing significantly to the broader Civil Rights Movement.
