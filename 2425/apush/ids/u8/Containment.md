## ID: [[Containment]] 
## When: 1947-1991 (Officially articulated in 1947, though the policy's influence lasted until the end of the Cold War.)

## Who:
* **George Kennan:** US Diplomat in Moscow; Author of the "Long Telegram" (1946) and "The Sources of Soviet Conduct" article (published as "X" in *Foreign Affairs*, 1947).  Kennan is considered the architect of the [[Containment]] Policy.
* **Harry S. Truman:** US President who officially adopted the [[Containment]] policy with the Truman Doctrine.

## What:
A US foreign policy strategy designed to prevent the spread of communism abroad. It advocated for using a variety of means – diplomatic, economic, and military – to contain the Soviet Union and its communist allies within their existing sphere of influence. It did *not* aim to overthrow existing communist regimes, but rather to prevent them from expanding. Key elements included:
* **Economic Aid:** Providing financial assistance to vulnerable nations to resist communist influence (e.g., Marshall Plan).
* **Military Alliances:** Forming defensive alliances to deter Soviet aggression (e.g., NATO).
* **Diplomatic Pressure:**  Using international diplomacy and organizations to isolate the Soviet Union and limit its influence.
* **Proxy Wars:** Supporting anti-communist forces in countries threatened by communist expansion (e.g., Korea, Vietnam).

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Shaped US Foreign Policy:** [[Containment]] became the dominant US foreign policy strategy for over four decades during the Cold War.
* **Justified Interventionism:**  It provided the rationale for US involvement in numerous conflicts around the world, including the [[Korean War]] and the Vietnam War, leading to significant loss of life and resources.
* **Arms Race:** Fueled the arms race between the [[United States]] and the Soviet Union, leading to a massive build-up of nuclear weapons and heightened global tensions.
* **Formation of Alliances:** Led to the creation of key [[Cold War]] alliances like [[NATO]] and SEATO, shaping the geopolitical landscape for decades.
* **Domestic Impact:**  Influenced domestic policy, including increased military spending, anti-communist sentiment (McCarthyism), and the development of a strong national security apparatus.
