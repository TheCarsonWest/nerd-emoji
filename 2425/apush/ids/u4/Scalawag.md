## ID: Scalawags (Reconstruction Era)

## When: 1865-1877 (Reconstruction Era)

## Who:  
White Southerners who collaborated with the Republican Party and the federal government during Reconstruction.

## What:
Scalawags were a diverse group of white Southerners, including former Unionists, small farmers, and some wealthy planters. They supported Reconstruction policies like:

* **Granting voting rights to African Americans.**
* **Establishing public schools for all children.**
* **Providing economic assistance to former slaves.**
* **Creating state governments that were more inclusive of African Americans.**

## Impact:  
Scalawags faced significant opposition from white Southerners who resented their support for Reconstruction. They were often accused of being "traitors" to the South and were subject to violence and intimidation.  Despite their efforts, many Reconstruction policies ultimately failed due to a lack of support and funding from the federal government. 

**Significance:** Scalawags represent a complex and often overlooked aspect of Reconstruction. They highlight the internal divisions within the South during this period and the struggles of those who sought to create a more just and equitable society.  The legacy of scalawags remains a reminder of the enduring challenge of racial reconciliation in the [[United States]].
