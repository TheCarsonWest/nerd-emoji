## ID: [[Bessemer Process]]

## When: 1850s (patented in 1856)

## Who:
* **Henry Bessemer:** British inventor who patented the process.  
* **American entrepreneurs and industrialists:**  Quickly adopted and scaled the process in the US.

## What: 
A steel-making process that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to remove impurities. This made steel production much faster, cheaper, and more efficient than previous methods.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Mass Production of Steel:** The Bessemer process enabled the mass production of high-quality steel, drastically lowering its cost.
* **Railroad Expansion:**  The availability of cheap steel fueled the rapid expansion of the railroad network across the [[United States]].  Stronger, lighter rails were crucial for this expansion.
* **Industrial Growth:**  The process was essential for the growth of many industries, including construction (skyscrapers, bridges), manufacturing (machines, tools), and weaponry.
* **[[Urbanization]]:**  Steel's use in construction contributed significantly to the rapid urbanization of the [[Gilded Age]].
* **Economic Growth:**  The increased efficiency and affordability of steel production contributed significantly to the overall economic expansion of the [[Gilded Age]].
