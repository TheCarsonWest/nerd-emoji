## ID: [[2425/apush/ids/u7/Treaty of Versailles]]

## When: June 28, 1919

## Who:
*   **[[Allied Powers]]:** Primarily [[Great Britain]] (David Lloyd George), [[France]] (Georges Clemenceau), and the [[United States]] ([[Woodrow Wilson]]), with contributions from Italy (Vittorio Orlando) and Japan.
*   **Germany:** Forced to accept the terms.

## What:
A treaty signed at the Palace of Versailles in [[France]] that officially ended World War I. It imposed harsh terms on Germany, including:
*   **Territorial Losses:** Germany lost significant territory, including Alsace-Lorraine to [[France]], parts of eastern Germany to Poland, and its colonies.
*   **Military Restrictions:** Germany's army was drastically reduced, and it was prohibited from having an air force, submarines, or heavy artillery.
*   **Reparations:** Germany was forced to pay massive reparations to the Allied powers for war damages.
*   **War Guilt Clause:** Article 231, the "War Guilt Clause," forced Germany to accept full responsibility for causing the war.
*   **[[2425/apush/ids/u7/League of Nations]]:** Created an international organization intended to prevent future wars.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
*   **German Resentment:** The harsh terms of the treaty created deep resentment in Germany, fostering a desire for revenge and contributing to the rise of extremist ideologies, including [[Nazism]].
*   **Economic Instability:** The heavy reparations burden crippled the German economy, leading to hyperinflation and widespread economic hardship.
*   **Failure of the [[2425/apush/ids/u7/League of Nations]]:** The US Senate refused to ratify the treaty or join the [[2425/apush/ids/u7/League of Nations]], weakening the organization and limiting its effectiveness.  Wilson's vision for a "peace without victory" was largely ignored.
*   **Seeds of WWII:**  The unresolved issues and grievances left by the [[2425/apush/ids/u7/Treaty of Versailles]] are widely considered to be a major contributing factor to the outbreak of World War II. The instability and resentment created a fertile ground for the rise of aggressive nationalist movements.
*   **US Isolationism:** The rejection of the treaty and the League by the US Senate reflected a desire to return to a policy of isolationism, avoiding entanglement in European affairs.
