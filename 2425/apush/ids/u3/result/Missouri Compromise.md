## What: 
A series of laws enacted by Congress to address the issue of slavery in new territories following [[Missouri]]'s application for statehood as a slave state. The main components were:
* **[[Missouri]] admitted as a slave state.**
* **[[Maine]] admitted as a free state** (previously part of [[Massachusetts]]) to maintain balance in the Senate.
* **The 36°30′ parallel:** Slavery prohibited in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory north of this line, except for [[Missouri]].

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
* **Temporary solution:** The Compromise temporarily defused the sectional crisis over slavery but ultimately failed to resolve the underlying tensions.
* **Precedent for  [[sectionalism]] :** It established a pattern of sectional compromises that characterized the antebellum period. 
* **Strengthened abolitionist movement:**  The debate surrounding the compromise fueled the growth of the abolitionist movement in the North.
* **Foreshadowed future conflict:**  The [[Missouri]] Compromise served as a precursor to the more significant crises over slavery that would culminate in the [[Civil War]].
