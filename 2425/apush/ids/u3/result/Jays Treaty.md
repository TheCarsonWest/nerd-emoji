# ID: Jay's Treaty
## When: 
November 19, 1794 (ratified by the Senate June 24, 1795)

## Who: 
* **Negotiated by:** John Jay, Chief Justice of the [[United States]] (sent by President [[Washington]])
* **Signed by:**  The [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]]

## What: 
A treaty resolving issues left unresolved since the end of the American Revolution. Key provisions included:

* Britain agreed to evacuate forts in the Northwest Territory (which they had continued to occupy illegally).
* A commission was established to settle boundary disputes and debts owed to British merchants.
* The U.S. received limited trading rights in the British West Indies.

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
* **Highly Controversial:**  The treaty was unpopular with many Americans, particularly Democratic-[[Republicans]], who saw it as a betrayal of [[France]] (then at war with [[Great Britain]]) and a concession to a tyrannical power. 
* **Strengthened Federalist Party:** The Federalists supported the treaty, arguing it maintained peace and trade with Britain. The controversy surrounding the treaty helped solidify the two-party system in the early [[United States]].
* **Indirectly Led to Other Agreements:** The treaty paved the way for Pinckney's Treaty (1795) with [[Spain]], which secured American access to the [[Mississippi]] River and New Orleans. It also temporarily eased tensions with Britain, although issues like impressment would continue to cause problems.
* **Demonstrated Challenges of Neutrality:** Jay's Treaty highlighted the difficulty for the newly formed [[United States]] to remain neutral in European conflicts, a recurring theme in early American history.
