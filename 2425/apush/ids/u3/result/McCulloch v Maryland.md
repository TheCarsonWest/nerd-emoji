# ID: McCulloch v. [[Maryland]] 

## WHEN: 1819

## WHO: 
* **Plaintiff:** James McCulloch, cashier of the Second Bank of the [[United States]] branch in Baltimore
* **Defendant:** State of [[Maryland]] 
* **Supreme Court Justices:**  John Marshall (Chief Justice)

## WHAT: 
A landmark Supreme Court case that centered around the constitutionality of the Second Bank of the [[United States]] and whether the state of [[Maryland]] could tax the bank's operations within its borders. The case addressed the balance of power between the federal government and state governments. 

## IMPACT: Why Significant?: 

* **Upheld Implied Powers:** The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice John Marshall, ruled that the establishment of the national bank, while not explicitly stated in the Constitution, was an implied power under the Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, Section 8). This significantly expanded the scope of the federal government's powers.
* **Supremacy Clause:** The Court affirmed the Supremacy Clause (Article VI), establishing that the Constitution and federal laws take precedence over state laws when the two are in conflict. 
* **Strengthened National Government:**  McCulloch v. [[Maryland]] tipped the balance of power in favor of the federal government, contributing to the growth of a strong national government. 
* **Long-Term Impact:**  The principles established in this case continue to influence the relationship between federal and state governments, particularly in areas like taxation, commerce, and regulation.
