# ID: [[Nat Turner Rebellion]] ## When: August 21-23, 1831
## Who: 
Nat Turner, a slave preacher and religious mystic, and about 70 enslaved people
## What: 
A slave rebellion in Southampton County, [[Virginia]], in which Turner and his followers killed approximately 60 white people, including women and children. 
## Impact: Why Significant?: 
The rebellion sent shockwaves throughout the South, leading to:
* **Increased fear and paranoia among white southerners:** This fueled support for stricter slave codes and heightened racial tensions.
* **Strengthened the institution of slavery:** The rebellion was used as justification for increased slave patrols, harsher punishments, and the suppression of any form of education or religious gatherings for enslaved people.
* **Limited abolitionist efforts:** The brutality of the rebellion and the resulting white backlash discouraged some abolitionists and made it more difficult to argue for emancipation.
* **Long-term impact on the South:** The rebellion served as a constant reminder of the potential for slave revolts, contributing to the South's growing sense of isolation and ultimately playing a role in the lead-up to the [[Civil War]].
