# ID: [[Proclamation of Neutrality]] 
## When: April 22, 1793
## Who: 
Issued by President George [[Washington]] 
## What:
Declared the [[United States]]' official neutrality in the conflict between [[Great Britain]] and [[France]].  It prohibited Americans from fighting for either side and barred French and British warships from American ports.
## Impact? Why Significant?: 
- Established a precedent of American neutrality in foreign wars, a principle largely followed throughout the 19th century. 
-  Angered pro-French Democratic-[[Republicans]] who felt obligated to help [[France]], leading to increased political partisanship between the Federalists and Democratic-[[Republicans]].
-  Contributed to strained relations with [[France]], ultimately leading to the Quasi-War (an undeclared naval war) between 1798 and 1800.
