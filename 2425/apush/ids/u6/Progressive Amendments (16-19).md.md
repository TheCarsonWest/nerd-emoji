## ID: Progressive Amendments (16th-19th)

## When: 1913-1920

## Who:  Progressive Era reformers, members of Congress, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (particularly relevant for the 19th Amendment's ratification)

## What:  Four constitutional amendments enacted during the Progressive Era addressing key social and political issues:

* **16th Amendment (1913):** Authorized the federal government to levy an income tax.
* **17th Amendment (1913):** Provided for the direct election of senators by the people of each state, rather than by state legislatures.
* **18th Amendment (1919):** Prohibited the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages (Prohibition).
* **19th Amendment (1920):** Granted women the right to vote (women's suffrage).


## Impact: Why Significant?:

* **16th Amendment:** Allowed the federal government to generate more revenue, enabling funding for social programs and expanding government services.  Shifted the tax burden more towards wealthier individuals.
* **17th Amendment:** Increased the democratic nature of the Senate, reducing the influence of state political machines and making senators more responsive to the electorate.
* **18th Amendment:** Led to a period of widespread lawlessness and the rise of organized crime, ultimately proving ineffective and repealed by the 21st Amendment.  It also reflected changing social attitudes towards alcohol and the role of government in regulating personal behavior.
* **19th Amendment:**  Expanded the electorate significantly and fundamentally changed the political landscape, allowing women to participate fully in the democratic process. This had wide-ranging social and political consequences, influencing legislation, elections, and social movements.  It marked a major victory for the women's suffrage movement.  The amendments collectively demonstrate the progressive movement's success in achieving meaningful political and social reforms at the federal level.
