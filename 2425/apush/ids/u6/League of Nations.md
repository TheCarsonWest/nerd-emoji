## ID: [[2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations]]

## WHEN: January 10, 1920 (Official start of operations)

## WHO:
* **[[Woodrow Wilson]]:**  President of the [[United States]], key architect of the League.
* **Allied and Associated Powers:**  Various nations victorious in World War I, including [[Great Britain]], [[France]], Italy, and Japan.

## WHAT:
An international organization created after World War I with the goal of maintaining world peace and preventing future conflicts.  Its primary function was to provide a forum for international diplomacy and collective security through arbitration and cooperation.  The League's Covenant, a part of the [[2425/apush/ids/u6/Treaty of Versailles]], outlined its structure and objectives.  The US, despite Wilson's efforts, ultimately did not join.

## IMPACT: Why Significant?:
* **Failed attempt at collective security:** While the League achieved some successes in mediating disputes and promoting international cooperation (e.g., handling mandates in former Ottoman territories), it ultimately failed to prevent World War II.  Its structure, hampered by the absence of major powers like the US and the Soviet Union, proved inadequate to address the growing tensions of the 1930s.
* **Precursor to the United Nations:** The League's failures highlighted the need for a more robust and effective international organization, leading to the creation of the United Nations after World War II.
* **US Isolationism:** The US Senate's rejection of the [[2425/apush/ids/u6/Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations]] contributed to a period of American isolationism in the interwar years. This contributed to a lack of engagement in international affairs before WWII.
* **Wilson's Legacy:** Wilson's passionate advocacy for the League, despite its eventual failure in the US, shaped his legacy and demonstrated his vision for a more peaceful world order.  The failure to join significantly damaged his presidency and his vision for post-war international cooperation.
