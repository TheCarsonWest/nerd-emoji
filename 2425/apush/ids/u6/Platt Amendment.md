## ID: [[Platt Amendment]]

## When: March 2, 1901

## Who: 
* **[[United States]]:**  Influenced its creation and implementation.
* **Cuba:**  Forced to accept the amendment as a condition for U.S. withdrawal of troops.

## What: 
An amendment to the U.S. Army Appropriations Act of 1901.  It stipulated seven conditions for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Cuba, effectively making Cuba a U.S. protectorate.  Key stipulations included limitations on Cuba's treaty-making power (requiring U.S. approval), the leasing of Guantanamo Bay to the U.S., and a commitment by Cuba to maintain a stable government.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **U.S. Imperialism:** The [[Platt Amendment]] exemplifies U.S. expansionism and its assertion of influence over Latin America during the Progressive Era. It showcased a willingness to intervene in the affairs of other nations under the guise of protecting U.S. interests.
* **Cuban Sovereignty:** The amendment severely restricted Cuban sovereignty and autonomy, despite Cuba's struggle for independence from [[Spain]]. This created resentment and dependence on the U.S.
* **Guantanamo Bay:** The leasing of Guantanamo Bay remains a contentious issue to this day, representing a constant reminder of the U.S.'s lingering imperial influence in Cuba.
* **Precedent for Future Interventions:** The [[Platt Amendment]] served as a precedent for future U.S. interventions in Latin America, justifying actions under the Roosevelt Corollary and contributing to strained relationships with nations in the region.
* **Limited Self-Determination:** The amendment underscored the limitations placed on newly independent nations in achieving true self-determination in the face of powerful external forces.
