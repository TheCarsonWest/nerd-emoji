## ID: The [[Great Migration]] (1916-1970)

## WHEN: 1916-1970 (primarily 1910s-1930s, with significant continuation afterwards)

## WHO:  African Americans from the rural South, primarily; industrial employers in Northern and Midwestern cities.

## WHAT:  The mass movement of over six million African Americans from the rural Southern [[United States]] to the urban North, Midwest, and West.  This was driven by a complex interplay of factors including:  the boll weevil infestation devastating Southern agriculture, the promise of industrial jobs in the North (fueled by WWI and subsequent industrial expansion), racial violence and discrimination in the South (Jim Crow laws, lynchings), and the hope for better social and economic opportunities.

## IMPACT: Why Significant?:
* **Transformation of Urban Landscapes:** Northern and Midwestern cities experienced significant demographic shifts, leading to the growth of Black communities and influencing urban development.
* **Rise of Black Political Power:** The increased concentration of Black populations in Northern cities led to the formation of strong political organizations and a rise in Black political influence.  This contributed to the growth of the Civil Rights Movement.
* **Cultural Change:** The [[Great Migration]] contributed to the flourishing of Black cultural expression in art, literature, music ([[Harlem Renaissance]]), and other areas.
* **Economic Change:** While facing continued discrimination, Black migrants contributed significantly to the industrial workforce and helped fuel economic growth in the North.
* **Increased Racial Tensions:** The influx of Black migrants led to increased racial tensions and competition for jobs and housing in many Northern cities, resulting in events like the Red Summer of 1919.
* **Shift in the South's economy and demographics:** The South lost a significant portion of its agricultural workforce, forcing economic adjustments and impacting social dynamics.  It ultimately altered the racial balance of power in the South, though racial inequality persisted.
* **Long-term effects on racial inequality:**  Though it offered opportunities for some, the [[Great Migration]] did not eradicate racial inequality.  Segregation and discrimination continued in the North, albeit in different forms.  The legacy of the migration continues to shape American society today.
