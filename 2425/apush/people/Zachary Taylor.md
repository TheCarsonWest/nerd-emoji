# [[POTUS]]
# Zachary Taylor: A Brief Overview
 
 ## Background
 *   **Dates:** Born November 24, 1784, Orange County, [[Virginia]]; Died July 9, 1850, [[Washington]], D.C.
 *   **Nickname:** "Old Rough and Ready"
 *   **Party:** Whig
 *   **Term:** 1849-1850
 *   **Vice President:** Millard Fillmore

 ## Military Career
 *   **War of 1812:** Gained recognition for his defense of Fort Harrison against Native American attacks.
 *   **Second Seminole War (1835-1842):** Achieved the rank of Brigadier General for his service.
 *   **Mexican-American War (1846-1848):** Rose to national prominence as a war hero due to victories at:
 *   **Battle of Palo Alto:** May 8, 1846
 *   **Battle of Resaca de la Palma:** May 9, 1846
 *   **Battle of Monterrey:** September 21-24, 1846
 *   **Battle of Buena Vista:** February 22-23, 1847 - A major victory against a larger Mexican force. This battle solidified his image as a tough and capable leader.
 
 ## Presidency (1849-1850)
 *   **Election of 1848:** Campaigned as a national hero, appealing to both Northern and Southern voters despite his lack of political experience. His stance on slavery was deliberately ambiguous.
 *   **Key Issues:**
 *   **Slavery and Sectionalism:** The issue of slavery in newly acquired territories from the Mexican-American War dominated his presidency. He advocated for [[Popular Sovereignty]], allowing residents of each territory to decide the issue for themselves.
 *   **California and New Mexico:** Taylor supported the immediate admission of [[California]] and [[New Mexico]] as states, even if they entered as free states. This angered many Southerners who saw it as a threat to the balance of power in Congress.
 *   **The [[Compromise of 1850]]:** Taylor opposed the [[Compromise of 1850]], a series of bills designed to resolve the slavery issue and avert [[sectionalism]].
 
 ## Legislation and Actions
 *   **Little Legislation:** His presidency was short and marked by sectional conflict, so he didn't sign much significant legislation.
 *   **Firm Stance on Secession:** Taylor threatened to use military force to prevent secession and preserve the Union. He made it clear that he considered the Union paramount.
 
 ## Political Affiliations
 *   **Whig Party:** Though he had little prior political experience, Taylor ran and won as a Whig. His appeal was largely based on his military reputation rather than strict adherence to Whig principles.
 
 ## Impact
 *   **Heightened Sectional Tensions:** Although he intended to calm them, Taylor's stance on [[California]] and [[New Mexico]] and his opposition to the [[Compromise of 1850]] initially intensified the debate over slavery, pushing the nation closer to [[Civil War]].
 *   **Uncertain Legacy:** His sudden death in 1850 left his policies unfinished and his long-term impact unclear. Millard Fillmore, his successor, adopted the [[Compromise of 1850]], which temporarily eased tensions but ultimately failed to resolve the underlying conflict.
 
 ## Death
 *   Taylor died on July 9, 1850, after a brief illness. Theories about his death ranged from cholera to poisoning, but historians generally attribute it to a gastrointestinal illness. His death significantly altered the political landscape, as his successor, Millard Fillmore, took a different approach to the sectional crisis.
