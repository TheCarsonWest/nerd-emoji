# [[POTUS]]
# Benjamin Harrison: AP US History Rundown

Benjamin Harrison was the 23rd [[POTUS]], serving from 1889 to 1893. A [[Republican]], his presidency was marked by significant legislative activity and economic developments.

## Key Events and Associations

*   **Grandson of William Henry Harrison:** Harrison came from a politically prominent family, which aided his career.
*   **Civil War Service:** He served as a brigadier general in the [[Civil War]].
*   **Senator from Indiana:** Prior to becoming president, Harrison served as a U.S. Senator from [[Indiana]].
*   **Sherman Antitrust Act:** Signed into law during his presidency.
*   **McKinley Tariff:** Another key piece of legislation during his term.
*   **Increased Federal Spending:** Harrison's administration saw a significant rise in federal spending, leading to concerns about the budget.

## Important Legislation

*   **[[Sherman Antitrust Act]]:** Passed in 1890, it was the first major U.S. law to limit monopolies and trusts. While its initial enforcement was weak, it set a precedent for future antitrust actions.
*   **[[McKinley Tariff]]:** Enacted in 1890, it raised tariffs to historically high levels. This was meant to protect American industries, but it also led to higher consumer prices and sparked international trade disputes.
*   **[[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]]:** Passed in 1890, this act required the U.S. government to purchase nearly twice as much silver as before, and added substantially to the amount of money already in circulation.
*   **[[Dependent Pension Act]]:** It provided pensions to Union veterans who had served for at least 90 days and were unable to work, regardless of whether their disability was war-related. This significantly increased the number of veterans receiving pensions and contributed to rising federal spending.

## Groups and Political Affiliations

*   **[[Republicans]]:** A staunch Republican, Harrison supported high tariffs and a strong national government.
*   **Grand Army of the Republic (GAR):** Harrison actively courted the support of this influential organization of Union Civil War veterans.
*   **Business Interests:** The [[Republicans]] of the time, including Harrison, were generally favorable toward businesses and industrial growth.

## Impact on the Country

*   **Increased Federal Power:** Harrison's administration expanded the role of the federal government in regulating the economy and providing benefits to certain groups (like Civil War veterans).
*   **Economic Debates:** The [[McKinley Tariff]] and [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] led to intense debates about trade policy and monetary policy, which continued to shape American politics for decades.
*   **Environmental Conservation:** Harrison designated several forest reserves, laying the groundwork for future conservation efforts.
*   **Loss of Re-election:** Despite the legislative achievements of his administration, Harrison lost the [[Presidential Election of 1896]] to [[Grover Cleveland]], largely due to public dissatisfaction with the [[McKinley Tariff]] and economic concerns.
