# Gerald Ford: A Rundown

Gerald Ford served as the 38th [[POTUS]] from 1974 to 1977. His presidency was largely defined by his efforts to heal the nation after the [[Watergate Scandal]] and navigate a period of economic stagnation.

## Key Events and Associations

*   **Watergate Scandal and Nixon Pardon:** Ford became president after [[Richard Nixon]]'s resignation in the wake of the [[Watergate Scandal]]. In a controversial move, Ford pardoned Nixon "for all offenses against the [[United States]] which he... has committed or may have committed or taken part in" while president. He argued that the pardon was necessary to help the country move forward, but it was met with widespread criticism and damaged his popularity. [[Nixon Pardon]]
