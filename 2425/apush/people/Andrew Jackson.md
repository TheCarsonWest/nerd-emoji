 ## Key Events and Associations
         
 *   **Military Career:**
  *  [[Battle of New Orleans]]:  A major general in the War of 1812, Jackson achieved national fame for his decisive victory against the [[Great Britain|British]] at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. This victory solidified his image as a military hero and propelled him into the political arena.
  *  [[First Seminole War]]: Led a controversial military campaign into [[Florida]] (then under [[Spain|Spanish]] control) in 1818, ostensibly to suppress Seminole Indian raids. This action led to the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]], where [[Spain]] ceded [[Florida]] to the [[United States]].
 *   **Presidential Elections:**
  *  [[Election of 1824]]: Jackson won the popular vote but lost the election to John Quincy Adams in a controversial decision by the House of Representatives (the "Corrupt Bargain").
  *  [[Election of 1828]]: Jackson won a landslide victory, ushering in an era of expanded suffrage and popular participation in politics.
  *  [[Election of 1832]]: Jackson secured re-election, defeating Henry Clay. This election was heavily influenced by the "Bank War" controversy.
 *   **Presidency:**
  *  **[[Spoils System]]:** Jackson embraced the practice of rewarding political supporters with government positions, which became known as the "spoils system." This practice, although controversial, was justified by Jackson as a way to ensure government responsiveness to the will of the people.
  *  **[[Indian Removal Act]]:** Signed in 1830, this act authorized the forced relocation of Native American tribes from their ancestral lands in the Southeast to lands west of the Mississippi River. This led to the infamous [[Trail of Tears]].
  *  **[[Nullification Crisis]]:** [[South Carolina]] declared the federal tariffs of 1828 and 1832 null and void within its borders, challenging federal authority. Jackson firmly opposed nullification, threatening military action to enforce federal law. The crisis was eventually resolved through a compromise tariff.
  *  **[[Bank War]]:** Jackson opposed the Second [[Bank of the United States]], viewing it as a corrupt and elitist institution. He vetoed the re-charter bill in 1832 and ultimately dismantled the bank by withdrawing federal funds.
