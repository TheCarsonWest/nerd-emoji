# [[POTUS]]
# Martin Van Buren: AP US History Rundown

## Overview

Martin Van Buren (1782-1862) was the eighth [[POTUS]], serving from 1837 to 1841. A key figure in the development of the Democratic Party, his presidency was largely defined by the economic crisis known as the [[Panic of 1837]].

## Key Events and Associations

*   **[[Election of 1828]]**: Van Buren played a significant role in organizing Andrew Jackson's successful campaign, solidifying his position as a leading Democrat.
*   **Secretary of State (1829-1831)**: Served under President [[Andrew Jackson]], further strengthening his political influence. He helped navigate the Eaton Affair and other challenges.
*   **Vice President (1833-1837)**: Served as Jackson's Vice President during his second term.
*   **[[Panic of 1837]]**: A major economic depression that began shortly after he took office and plagued his entire presidency. It was caused by a combination of factors, including Jackson's policies regarding the national bank and speculation in western lands.
*   **Independent Treasury Act (1840)**: Established an independent treasury system to manage government funds, separating them from private banks.
*   **Aroostook War (1838-1839)**: A border dispute between Maine and [[Great Britain]] (Canada) that Van Buren helped to resolve peacefully through negotiation.
*   **Amistad Case (1839)**: Dealt with the legal and diplomatic ramifications of the *Amistad* slave ship rebellion.

## Important Legislation and Actions

*   **Independent Treasury Act (1840)**: This was Van Buren's major legislative achievement. It created a system where the government kept its funds in its own vaults, rather than depositing them in private or state banks. This was intended to stabilize the economy and prevent speculation.

## Groups and Affiliations

*   **[[Democrats]]**: Van Buren was a key architect of the Democratic Party, working with [[Andrew Jackson]] to build a national political organization.
*   **Albany Regency**: A powerful political machine in New York State that Van Buren helped to establish and lead. It used patronage and organization to maintain control over state politics.
*   **Free Soil Party (1848)**: He ran for president as a candidate for the Free Soil Party.

## Impact on the Country

*   **Development of the Democratic Party**: Van Buren's organizational skills and political acumen were crucial in shaping the Democratic Party into a modern political force.
*   **Response to the Panic of 1837**: His response to the economic crisis was controversial and largely ineffective. While the Independent Treasury Act aimed to stabilize the financial system, it did little to alleviate the immediate suffering caused by the depression.
*   **Preservation of Peace**: Successfully avoided war with [[Great Britain]] over the Aroostook War through diplomacy and negotiation.
*   **Anti-Slavery Stance**: While not an abolitionist, Van Buren's later affiliation with the Free Soil Party demonstrated a growing concern over the expansion of slavery.
