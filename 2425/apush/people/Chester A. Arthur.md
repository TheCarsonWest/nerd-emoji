# [[POTUS]]
# Chester A. Arthur: AP US History Rundown

## Overview

Chester A. Arthur (1829-1886) served as the 21st [[POTUS]] of the [[United States]] from 1881 to 1885. He ascended to the presidency upon the assassination of [[James A. Garfield]]. Known for his unexpected commitment to civil service reform, Arthur transitioned from a machine politician to a relatively principled president.

## Key Events and Associations

*   **Customs Collector of the Port of New York:** Prior to becoming vice president, Arthur held this highly lucrative and politically influential position. It was a key component of the patronage system, and Arthur himself benefitted greatly from it. This appointment was under President [[Ulysses S. Grant]].
*   **Assassination of James A. Garfield (1881):** Garfield's death elevated Arthur to the presidency. This event created a vacuum for Arthur to take charge of reform, as many were shocked by the assassination and sought change in the system that enabled it.
*   **Civil Service Reform:** Arthur's unexpected championing of civil service reform was a direct response to the corruption that led to Garfield's assassination.

## Important Legislation Signed

*   **[[Pendleton Act]] (1883):** This landmark legislation established the [[United States]] Civil Service Commission and mandated that some federal government positions be awarded based on merit rather than political affiliation. This was a watershed moment in curbing the [[Spoils System]] that had dominated American politics.
*   **Tariff Act of 1883 (Mongrel Tariff):** A compromise bill that lowered some tariff rates but left many others unchanged. It pleased neither high-tariff nor low-tariff advocates, reflecting the complex political forces at play during the [[Gilded Age]].

## Groups and Factions

*   **[[Republicans]]**: Arthur was a lifelong Republican, associated with the Stalwart faction, which supported the spoils system.
*   **Stalwarts vs. Half-Breeds:** The Republican Party was divided between the Stalwarts (led by Roscoe Conkling, who supported patronage) and the Half-Breeds (led by James G. Blaine, who advocated for civil service reform). Arthur was initially associated with the Stalwarts, but his presidency saw him shift towards the Half-Breed position on civil service reform.

## Impact on the Country

*   **Civil Service Reform:** The [[Pendleton Act]] marked the beginning of the end of the [[Spoils System]] in the [[United States]] federal government. It laid the groundwork for a more professional and merit-based civil service, reducing the influence of political machines.
*   **Modernization of the Navy:** Arthur oversaw the beginning of a significant modernization of the U.S. Navy, recognizing the need for a stronger naval presence in a rapidly changing world.
*   **Reduced Political Corruption:** While corruption certainly did not disappear, Arthur's efforts contributed to a gradual decline in the blatant political corruption that had characterized the post-[[Civil War]] era.

## Additional Considerations

*   **"Prince Arthur":** This was a derisive nickname Arthur received before his presidency, referring to his perceived lavish lifestyle and association with the New York political machine.
*   **Unsuccessful Re-election Bid:** Despite his success in implementing civil service reform, Arthur was not nominated for a second term by the Republican Party in 1884, due to his perceived betrayal of the Stalwarts and his ill health (he suffered from Bright's disease, a kidney ailment).
