# James Buchanan: A Rundown

James Buchanan was the 15th President of the [[United States]], serving from 1857 to 1861. His presidency is widely considered a failure, primarily due to his inability to effectively address the escalating [[sectionalism]] leading to the [[Civil War]].

## Key Events and Associations

*   **[[Dred Scott v Sandford]] (1857):** Shortly after Buchanan took office, the Supreme Court issued this landmark decision. Buchanan publicly supported the decision, which inflamed tensions between the North and South. Many Northerners viewed it as a pro-slavery decision pushed by Southern influence in the government.
*   **Panic of 1857:** An economic downturn that exacerbated existing sectional tensions. Buchanan's response, characterized by his belief in limited government intervention, was criticized for being inadequate.
*   **[[Bleeding Kansas]]:** The ongoing violence in Kansas over the issue of slavery continued to be a major crisis during Buchanan's presidency. Buchanan supported the Lecompton Constitution, a pro-slavery document that was ultimately rejected by Congress, further fueling the conflict.
*   **[[Harpers Ferry Raid]] (1859):** John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry heightened fears in the South of Northern abolitionist conspiracies and further widened the divide between the regions.
*   **Secession Crisis:** As Southern states began to secede following the [[Election of 1860]], Buchanan took a largely passive approach, arguing that secession was illegal but that he lacked the constitutional authority to prevent it.

## Important Legislation

*   **None of significant note.** Buchanan vetoed several bills, including one that would have provided land for agricultural colleges. His focus was on maintaining the status quo and avoiding actions that could be seen as favoring either the North or the South.

## Groups and Affiliations

*   **[[Democrats]]:** Buchanan was a lifelong Democrat. His political career was built on loyalty to the party. He represented Pennsylvania in both the House and the Senate.
*   **"Doughface":** A term used to describe Northern politicians with Southern sympathies, Buchanan was often labeled as such due to his attempts to appease the South and preserve the Union through compromise.

## Impact on the Country

*   **Exacerbation of Sectionalism:** Buchanan's presidency is largely viewed as a failure due to his ineffective handling of the growing divide over slavery. His policies and inaction are seen as having contributed to the escalation of tensions that ultimately led to the [[Civil War]].
*   **Weakened Presidential Authority:** By arguing that he lacked the authority to prevent secession, Buchanan set a precedent that weakened the power of the presidency at a crucial moment in American history.
*   **Legacy of Inaction:** Buchanan left office with the country on the brink of civil war, and his legacy is one of indecision and a failure to address the most pressing issue facing the nation. He is consistently ranked as one of the worst presidents in American history.
