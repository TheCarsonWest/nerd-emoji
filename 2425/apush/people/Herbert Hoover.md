# [[POTUS]]
# Herbert Hoover: AP US History Rundown

## Overview
Herbert Hoover (1874-1964) served as the 31st President of the [[United States]] from 1929 to 1933. A Republican, he entered office with a strong reputation as a humanitarian and administrator, largely stemming from his efforts during and after World War I. However, his presidency is largely remembered for the onset of the [[Great Depression]] and his perceived inadequate response, leading to his defeat in the 1932 election.

## Key Events Associated with Herbert Hoover

*   **Pre-Presidency Humanitarian Work:** Before entering politics, Hoover was a successful mining engineer. He gained international recognition for organizing food relief efforts in Europe during and after World War I.
    *   **Belgian Relief (WWI):** Hoover led the Commission for Relief in Belgium, providing food and aid to occupied Belgium during the war.
*   **Secretary of Commerce (1921-1928):** Served under Presidents Warren G. Harding and [[Calvin Coolidge]], where he modernized the Department of Commerce and promoted American business interests.
*   **[[Stock Market Crash of 1929]]:** Occurring just months into his presidency, the crash marked the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. Hoover's initial response was characterized by a belief in *[[Rugged Individualism]]* and limited government intervention.
*   **[[Great Depression]]:** The economic downturn that defined Hoover's presidency. Unemployment soared, banks failed, and widespread poverty gripped the nation.
*   **[[Bonus Army]]:** In 1932, World War I veterans marched on Washington D.C. to demand early payment of bonuses promised to them. Hoover ordered the army to evict the protestors, resulting in violence that further damaged his reputation.

## Important Legislation Signed
Hoover's actions were constrained by his philosophical belief in limited government intervention, but several pieces of legislation were enacted during his presidency:

*   **Agricultural Marketing Act (1929):** Established the Federal Farm Board with the goal of stabilizing agricultural prices through government-sponsored cooperatives. Largely ineffective in combating the agricultural crisis of the Depression.
*   **Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act (1930):** Raised tariffs on imported goods, intending to protect American industries. It is widely considered to have worsened the [[Great Depression]] by hindering international trade.
*   **[[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) (1932):** Provided loans to banks, railroads, and other businesses to stimulate economic activity. This was a significant step towards government intervention, but it was criticized for being too little, too late, and primarily benefiting large corporations.

## Groups and Affiliations

*   **[[Republicans]]:** Lifelong member of the Republican Party, believing in limited government and individual responsibility.
*   **Progressives:** While a Republican, Hoover embraced some elements of the [[Progressivism]], particularly in his emphasis on efficiency and expertise in government.
*   **Business Elites:** Enjoyed close ties with the business community due to his background as an engineer and administrator.

## Impact on the Country

*   **Failed to Solve the [[Great Depression]]:** Hoover's most significant impact was his failure to effectively address the [[Great Depression]]. His adherence to laissez-faire principles and initial reluctance to engage in direct government intervention led to widespread suffering and discontent.
*   **Shift in Attitudes Toward Government Intervention:** Despite his initial reluctance, Hoover's administration took some steps towards government intervention in the economy. The creation of the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] and other initiatives laid the groundwork for the more extensive [[New Deal]] policies of his successor, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].
*   **Damaged Public Trust in Government:** The handling of the [[Bonus Army]] protest and the perceived inadequacy of Hoover's response to the [[Great Depression]] eroded public trust in the government's ability to address economic crises.
*   **Precedent for Later Economic Policies:** Some historians argue that the RFC, while not completely successful, set a precedent for later government interventions in the economy, demonstrating that the government could play a role in stabilizing financial institutions.
*   **Humanitarian Legacy:** Despite his controversial presidency, Hoover's earlier humanitarian work continued to be recognized, particularly his efforts to alleviate hunger and suffering during and after World War I.

## In Summary
Herbert Hoover was a complex figure whose presidency was largely overshadowed by the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. While his commitment to [[Rugged Individualism]] and limited government intervention initially constrained his response to the crisis, his administration eventually took steps towards greater government involvement in the economy. Despite his efforts, Hoover's failure to effectively address the Depression led to widespread discontent and ultimately paved the way for the [[New Deal]].
