## Background
*   Born in Missouri in 1884.
*   Served in World War I as an artillery officer.
*   Entered politics in the 1920s, becoming a judge and then a Senator from Missouri in 1934.
*   Chosen as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s Vice President in 1944, assuming the presidency upon FDR's death in April 1945.

## Major Events and Policies:

*   **End of World War II:**
    *   **[[Potsdam Conference]] (1945):** Met with Allied leaders to discuss the post-war reorganization of Europe.
    *   **Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945):** Truman made the controversial decision to use atomic weapons against Japan to force its surrender, believing it would save American lives by avoiding a costly invasion. This decision has lasting ethical and strategic implications.
    *   Oversaw the formal surrender of Japan and the beginning of the post-war world.
*   **Post-War Era & the Beginning of the Cold War:**
    *   **[[Truman Doctrine]] (1947):** Policy of providing economic and military aid to countries resisting communist influence, initially Greece and Turkey.  This marked a significant shift in US foreign policy towards active containment of communism.
    *   **[[Marshall Plan]] (1948):**  Massive economic aid package to help rebuild Western Europe after WWII, aimed at preventing the spread of communism by fostering economic stability.
    *   **[[Berlin Blockade]] and Airlift (1948-1949):**  The Soviet Union blocked access to West Berlin; Truman ordered a massive airlift of supplies to sustain the city until the blockade was lifted. A defining moment of the early [[Cold War]].
    *   **[[NATO]] (1949):**  Formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance among the US, Canada, and Western European nations, to provide collective security against the Soviet Union.
*   **Domestic Policy:**
    *   **[[Truman’s Fair Deal]]**: An ambitious set of proposals for social and economic reform, including expansion of Social Security, increased minimum wage, national health insurance, and civil rights legislation. Faced opposition from Congress, but achieved some successes.
    *   **Desegregation of the Military (1948):** Executive Order 9981 abolished racial discrimination in the US armed forces, a landmark achievement for civil rights.
    *   **Labor Relations:** Navigated post-war labor unrest, including major strikes.
    *   **[[Taft-Hartley Act]] (1947):**  Passed by Congress over Truman's veto, this act restricted the power of labor unions.
*   **[[Korean War]] (1950-1953):**
    *   North Korea invaded South Korea, prompting Truman to commit US troops under a United Nations mandate.
    *   General Douglas MacArthur was dismissed for publicly disagreeing with Truman's strategy of limited war.
    *   The war ended in a stalemate, reinforcing the [[Containment]] policy and leading to a significant increase in military spending.
*   **Second Red Scare:** The fear of communist infiltration within the U.S. government and society. Truman established a loyalty program for federal employees, but also worried about the excesses of [[McCarthyism]].

## Important Legislation Signed:

*   **National Security Act of 1947:** Established the Department of Defense, the National Security Council (NSC), and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), modernizing the U.S. national security apparatus.
*   **Housing Act of 1949:** Aimed to provide federal funding for public housing and urban renewal.
*   **Social Security Amendments of 1950:** Expanded Social Security coverage and increased benefits.
