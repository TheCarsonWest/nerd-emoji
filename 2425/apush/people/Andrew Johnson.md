# [[POTUS]]
# Andrew Johnson: A Contentious Presidency

Andrew Johnson (1808-1875) served as the 17th [[POTUS]] of the [[United States]] from 1865 to 1869, following the [[The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln]]. His presidency was largely defined by his clashes with Congress over [[Reconstruction]] policies after the [[Civil War]], ultimately leading to his impeachment.

## Background

*   Born into poverty in Raleigh, North Carolina.
*   Self-educated and became a tailor.
*   Moved to Tennessee and entered politics, serving as a mayor, state legislator, U.S. Congressman, and U.S. Senator.
*   A Democrat who remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War, he was appointed military governor of Tennessee.
*   Chosen as [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's]] Vice President in 1864 as a gesture of unity.

## Key Events and Policies

*   **Presidential Reconstruction (1865-1866):** [[Andrew Johnson|Johnson]] implemented a lenient plan for Reconstruction, which aimed to quickly restore the Southern states to the Union. His plan included:
    *   Pardons to former Confederates who pledged allegiance to the Union.
    *   Required Southern states to ratify the [[13th amendment]], abolishing slavery.
    *   Allowed Southern states to establish new governments with limited federal oversight.
    *   This plan was viewed by many in the north as being too lenient, and many states took advantage of the loose regulation to implement things such as [[Black Codes]] that curtailed the freedoms of African-Americans.

*   **Vetoes of Congressional Reconstruction Legislation:** [[Andrew Johnson|Johnson]] repeatedly vetoed legislation passed by the [[Radical Republicans]] in Congress that aimed to protect the rights of freedmen and punish the South, including:
    *   [[Freedmans Bureau|Extension of the Freedmen's Bureau]]: The Freedmen's Bureau was designed to aid former slaves in the South.
    *   [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]]: Granted citizenship to all persons born in the [[United States]] (excluding Native Americans) and prohibited discrimination based on race.

*   **Clash with Congress:** Johnson's vetoes and his opposition to Congressional Reconstruction policies led to a bitter power struggle with the [[Radical Republicans]] who controlled Congress.

*   **[[Tenure of Office Act]] (1867):** Congress passed this act to restrict the president's power to remove cabinet members without Senate approval, aiming to protect Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican]] and Johnson critic.

*   **Impeachment (1868):** [[Andrew Johnson|Johnson]] violated the [[Tenure of Office Act]] by firing Edwin Stanton. The House of Representatives impeached him for "high crimes and misdemeanors." He was tried by the Senate and acquitted by one vote, avoiding removal from office.

*   **Purchase of Alaska (1867):** Secretary of State William Seward negotiated the purchase of [[Alaska]] from Russia for $7.2 million.  Often ridiculed as "Seward's Folly," the acquisition later proved to be a valuable resource.

## Important Legislation Signed (Limited)

*   Little significant legislation was signed due to Johnson's conflicts with Congress. The most notable was the [[Alaska]] purchase treaty.

## Groups and Affiliations

*   [[Democrats]]: Johnson was a lifelong Democrat.
*   National Union Party: A short-lived coalition party during the 1864 election, aimed at uniting Republicans and War Democrats.

## Impact on the Country

*   **Delayed Reconstruction:** His opposition to Congressional Reconstruction prolonged the process of rebuilding the South and integrating freedmen into society.
*   **Increased Racial Tensions:** His lenient policies towards the South and his vetoes of civil rights legislation emboldened white Southerners and contributed to the rise of [[Jim Crow Laws]].
*   **Weakened Presidency:** The impeachment proceedings weakened the office of the president and established limits on executive power in relation to Congress.
*   **Solidified Republican Control:** Johnson's actions helped to solidify the [[Republicans|Republican]] Party's control over Congress and the nation for several years.
