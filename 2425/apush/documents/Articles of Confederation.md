Write an AP [[United States]] History Rundown on the articles of confederation


**[[Articles of Confederation]] (1781-1789)**

**Background:**
* Adopted after the [[Declaration of Independence]] in 1781
* First constitution of the [[United States]]
* Replaced the Continental Congress

**Key Features:**

**Weaknesses:**
* **Loose Confederation:** States retained most power, with the federal government having limited authority.
* **No Executive Branch:** No president or other executive figure.
* **Weak Legislature:** Congress could only pass laws with unanimous consent of all states.
* **No Judicial Branch:** No federal courts to enforce laws.
* **No Power to Tax:** Congress could not raise revenue directly from the states.
* **No Power to Regulate Commerce:** States controlled trade within and between their borders.
* **No Power to Declare War or Make Peace:** States made their own foreign policy decisions.

**Strengths:**
* **Declaration of Rights:** Included a [[Bill of Rights]] that protected individual liberties.
* **Land Ordinance of 1785:** Established a system for selling and surveying western lands.
* **Northwest Ordinance of 1787:** Organized the Northwest Territory and set principles for new states.

**Reasons for Failure:**
* Inability to address the nation's financial crisis
* Inability to regulate commerce and prevent economic instability
* Weak enforcement mechanisms for federal laws
* Growing tensions between states over western land claims
* Lack of a strong central government to resolve disputes and protect national interests

**Replacement:**
* The [[Articles of Confederation]] were replaced by the Constitution of the [[United States]] in 1789, which established a stronger federal government with more powers.
