# [[Volumes With Cross Sections]]
# Area Formulas for Common Shapes: AP Calculus AB Rundown

This rundown covers area formulas for common geometric shapes, which are fundamental for understanding area calculations in calculus, particularly when dealing with integration and related rates problems.

## 1. Rectangle

*   **Formula:**

    $$
    A = lw
    $$

    where:
    *   `A` is the area
    *   `l` is the length
    *   `w` is the width

## 2. Square

*   **Formula:**

    $$
    A = s^2
    $$

    where:
    *   `A` is the area
    *   `s` is the side length

## 3. Triangle

*   **Formula:**

    $$
    A = \frac{1}{2}bh
    $$

    where:
    *   `A` is the area
    *   `b` is the base
    *   `h` is the height (perpendicular to the base)

    [[**Note on Height**]]: The height *must* be perpendicular to the base. For non-right triangles, you may need to use trigonometry to find the height.

## 4. Circle

*   **Formula:**

    $$
    A = \pi r^2
    $$

    where:
    *   `A` is the area
    *   `r` is the radius

## 5. Trapezoid

*   **Formula:**

    $$
    A = \frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h
    $$

    where:
    *   `A` is the area
    *   `b_1` and `b_2` are the lengths of the parallel bases
    *   `h` is the height (perpendicular distance between the bases)

    [[**Trapezoid Bases**]]: Make sure you identify the parallel sides as the bases.

## 6. Parallelogram

*   **Formula:**

    $$
    A = bh
    $$

    where:
    *   `A` is the area
    *   `b` is the base
    *   `h` is the height (perpendicular distance between the base and the opposite side)

    [[**Parallelogram Height**]]:  The height is NOT the length of the slanted side.

## 7. Sector of a Circle

*   **Formula:**

    $$
    A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta
    $$

    where:
    *   `A` is the area
    *   `r` is the radius
    *   `\theta` is the central angle in *radians*

    [[**Radian Measure**]]: Always ensure the angle is in radians when using this formula. Convert from degrees if necessary:  `radians = degrees * (Ï€/180)`.
## Application in Calculus

These formulas are crucial for:

*   **Area between curves:** Finding the area between two functions, `f(x)` and `g(x)`, between `x = a` and `x = b`:

    $$
    A = \int_a^b |f(x) - g(x)| dx
    $$

*   **Volumes of revolution:** Using methods like the disk/washer or shell method to find the volume of a solid generated by rotating a region around an axis.  These methods rely on integrating the area of cross-sections (often circles or washers).

*   **Related rates problems:** Setting up equations that relate the rates of change of different variables, often involving area formulas. For example, if the radius of a circle is increasing at a certain rate, you can use the area formula to find the rate at which the area is increasing.

*   **Optimization Problems:** Where you might need to maximize or minimize an area given certain constraints.

Remember to always draw a diagram when possible and carefully identify the relevant dimensions and variables.  Understanding these basic area formulas is essential for success in AP Calculus AB.
