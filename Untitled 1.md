Make a AP Chemistry note page on ({name}) in markdown format:
- make use of headings
- use the LaTeX equation library format when writing equations.($$Two dollar signs for a block equation$$, $One dollar sign for an inline equation$
- For any topic that you believe needs its own independent explanation, enclose it in TWO brackets([[like this]]). The notes page for that will be generated solely off of its title, so make sure its specific enough.
- There are already many other notes pages that you can reference by doing the [[double brackets]]. Enclosing them in double brackets like this will create a link to the page with that title for the user. Here is a list of all of the other topic that have already been written about
