The Behavioral Perspective is the approach where you prioritize observing the external behaviors and actions of a human or animal, rather than worrying about internal factors that lead to the behaviors. The behavioral perspective is only concerned with how a person or animal responds to its environment, and how it is conditioned by it. To be a 'behavioralist', you have to assume that there are no innate behaviors that can overpower what can be conditioned through someone's environment. 

Another resource on the Behavioral Perspective: [https://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviorism.html](https://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviorism.html)

I think that the behaviorist perspective can best explain human behavior as almost all of our actions we do every day have been shaped by our environment. Our habits, fears, etiquette, and everyday interactions are all shaped by our environment. For example, we learn behaviors as simple as speaking a language through operant conditioning. When we speak nonsense as a small child, our parents are unfazed, but when we can form a word, we will get an excited response that tells us that we need to make more of that sound. While not a complete picture of psychology as a whole, the behaviorist perspective does take the most scientific approach to psychology, meaning its findings should be able to be reproduced and verified. Because the behavioral perspective can explain a wide range of our behaviors and the easiest perspective to approach scientifically, it serves as the best perspective to explain our behaviors.

Here is what a peer wrote about their perspective, the psychodynamic perspective 
```
**Describe the Perspective in Your Own Words:** The cognitive perspective focuses on how people process information, think, remember, and solve problems. It suggests that our thoughts and mental processes influence how we behave and make decisions. This approach highlights the importance of understanding internal mental states like perception, memory, and decision-making.

**Educational Resource:** A great resource to dive deeper into the cognitive perspective is the book _Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook_ by Margaret W. Matlin. This book offers comprehensive insights into cognitive processes and their relation to human behavior.

**WHY I believe this perspective best explains human thought and behavior :** The cognitive perspective offers a logical approach to understanding human thought and behavior by examining the mental processes that drive actions. This approach highlights how individuals interpret and make sense of their experiences, which directly affects their behavior. Cognitive theories, like the information-processing model, suggest that the mind functions similarly to a computer, taking in information, processing it, and then making decisions based on this data. For instance, cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, can explain why people tend to seek information that supports their existing beliefs. This perspective also emphasizes learning through observation and internal representation, aligning with theories from prominent psychologists like Piaget and Vygotsky. Understanding these mental processes allows us to predict and analyze human actions in various contexts, from education to therapy, making it a powerful lens for studying human behavior.

answer these questions about theirs compared to mine
```
1. State how the perspective is similar to the perspective you selected. (2-3 sentences)
2. State how the perspective is different from the perspective you selected. (2-3 sentences)
3. Discuss at least one thing you learned from their information. (2-3 sentences)
```

here is a sample response (me responding to the psychodynamic appraoch)

```
Similar to the behavioral perspective, your perspective also tries to explain the root cause of current behavior. Both perspectives also try to see how past experiences/environments affect present behaviors, however on a different time scale.

Differences in the two perspectives come in how they try to explain the cause of current behavior. While the behavioral perspective says that behavior is just shaped by the environment, and not by anything else, the psychodynamic perspective focuses on how unconscious processes and childhood development affect the behavior. To sum it up, the behavioral perspective thinks that you can replicate the same behavior with the same environment with two completely different people(two different animals, even), while the psychodynamic perspective thinks that they will make different behaviors because of unconscious processed they got from development.

From your reply I learned that the behavioral perspective is flawed in that it oversimplifies behavior. The psychodynamic approach is able to correct for that by saying that everything shapes everything, and that it is difficult to account for every factor that goes into every decision.

Okay, here's an analysis of the cognitive perspective compared to your behavioral perspective, answering your questions based on the provided text:

**1. State how the perspective is similar to the perspective you selected. (2-3 sentences)**

Both the behavioral and cognitive perspectives attempt to explain how experiences shape behavior. While the behavioral perspective focuses on external conditioning, the cognitive perspective focuses on how internal mental processes, like interpretation and memory, are formed by experiences, and ultimately affect behavior. Both perspectives emphasize the importance of understanding how past events influence present actions and decisions.

**2. State how the perspective is different from the perspective you selected. (2-3 sentences)**

The fundamental difference lies in what each perspective prioritizes. The behavioral perspective emphasizes observable behaviors and environmental stimuli, while the cognitive perspective delves into internal mental processes like thinking, remembering, and problem-solving. The behavioral perspective largely dismisses internal states, whereas the cognitive perspective considers them crucial for understanding behavior, likening the mind to a computer processing information.

**3. Discuss at least one thing you learned from their information. (2-3 sentences)**

I learned that the cognitive perspective provides a framework for understanding how internal mental processes, such as cognitive biases, can significantly influence behavior. The example of confirmation bias helps illustrate how people actively seek information that supports existing beliefs, which is something not directly addressed in the behavioral perspective, highlighting the importance of internal processes.



create an analogy of how the cognitive perspective views the mind compared to how the behavioral persepctive views the mind



Here's an analogy to illustrate the difference between how the cognitive and behavioral perspectives view the mind:

**Behavioral Perspective: The mind is like a black box.** We can see what goes *in* (stimulus) and what comes *out* (behavior), but we don't need to worry about what's happening *inside*. It's all about the input-output relationship and how it's shaped by conditioning. Like a vending machine: put in the right money (stimulus), get the desired snack (behavior). We don't need to know how the machine works internally to predict what will happen.

**Cognitive Perspective: The mind is like a computer.** It actively processes information through various programs (mental processes like memory, attention, and problem-solving). It's not just about input and output; it's about how the information is encoded, stored, retrieved, and manipulated to produce a response. Like a computer running software: the same input can lead to different outputs depending on the software running and the current state of the system.
