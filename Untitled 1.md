How It Feels to Be Colored Me

Zora Neale Hurston

Zora Neale Hurston (1891-1960) came to prominence in the 1920s during the Harlem Renaissance, a period of enormous creativity of African American artists, writers, and musicians. A novelist, folklorist, and anthropologist, she first gained attention with her short stories, including "Sweat" and "Spunk." She is best known for her novel Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), set in Eatonville, Florida, where Hurston grew up; the town was the first incorporated African American community in the United States. She attended Howard University and won a scholarship to Barnard College in New York City, living in Harlem throughout the 1920s. Toward the end of her life, Hurston remained out of the public eye; she was buried in an unmarked grave in Florida.

KEY CONTEXT Hurston is a major figure of the Harlem Renaissance, an artistic movement spanning the 1920s and 1930s that celebrated Black life and culture. Most of her writing takes place in the American South, where Jim Crow laws enforced racial segregation from the 1870s through the 1960s. "How It Feels to Be Colored Me" was first published in The World Tomorrow, a progressive political magazine that was an encouraging home for Harlem Renaissance writers, in May 1928.
# Main passage

I am colored but I offer nothing in the way of extenuating circumstances except the fact that I am the only Negro in the United States whose grandfather on the mother's side was not an Indian chief.

I remember the very day that I became col-ored. Up to my thirteenth year I lived in the little Negro town of Eatonville, Florida. It is exclusively a colored town. The only white people I knew passed through the town going to or coming from Orlando. The native whites rode dusty horses, the Northern tourists chugged down the sandy village road in automobiles. The town knew the Southerners and never stopped cane chewing when they passed. But the Northerners were something else again. They were peered at cautiously from behind curtains by the timid.

The more venturesome would come out on the porch to watch them go past and got just as much pleasure out of the tourists as the tourists got out of the village.

The front porch might seem a daring place for the rest of the town, but it was a gallery seat for me. My favorite place was atop the gate-post. Proscenium box for a born first-nighter.

Not only did I enjoy the show, but I didn't mind the actors knowing that I liked it. I usually spoke to them in passing. I'd wave at them and when they returned my salute, I would say something like this: "Howdy-do-well-I-thank-you-where-you-goin'?" Usually automobile or the horse paused at this, and after a queer exchange of compliments, I would probably "go a piece of the way" with them, as we say in farthest Florida. If one of my family happened to come to the front in time to see me, of course negotiations would be rudely broken off. But even so, it is clear that I was the first "welcome-to-our-state" Floridian, and I hope the Miami Chamber of Commerce will please take notice.During this period, white people differed from colored to me only in that they rode through town and never lived there. They liked to hear me "speak pieces" and sing and wanted to see me dance the parse-me-la, and gave me generously of their small silver for doing these things, which seemed strange to me for I wanted to do them so much that I needed bribing to stop. Only they didn't know it. The colored people gave no dimes. They deplored any joyful tendencies in me, but I was their Zora nevertheless.
I belonged to them, to the nearby hotels, to the county — everybody's Zora.
But changes came in the family when I was thirteen, and I was sent to school in Jacksonville.
I left Eatonville, the town of the oleanders, as Zora. When I disembarked from the river-boat at Jacksonville, she was no more. It seemed that I had suffered a sea change. I was not Zora of Orange County any more, I was now a little colored girl. I found it out in certain ways. In my heart as well as in the mirror, I became a fast brown — warranted not to rub nor run.
But I am not tragically colored. There is no great sorrow dammed up in my soul, nor lurking behind my eyes. I do not mind at all.
I do not belong to the sobbing school of Negrohood who hold that nature somehow has given them a lowdown dirty deal and whose feelings are all hurt about it. Even in the helter-skelter skirmish that is my life, I have seen that the world is to the strong regardless of a little pigmentation more or less. No, I do not weep at the world — I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife.
Someone is always at my elbow reminding me that I am the granddaughter of slaves. It fails to register depression with me. Slavery is sixty years in the past. The operation was successful and the patient is doing well, thank you. The terrible struggle that made me an American out of a potential slave said "On the line!" The Reconstruction' said "Get set!"; and the generation before said "Go!" I am off to a flying start and I must not halt in the stretch to look behind and weep. Slavery is the price I paid for civilization, and the choice was not with me. It is a bully adventure and worth all that I have paid through my ancestors for it. No one on earth ever had a greater chance for glory. The world to be won and nothing to be lost. It is thrilling to think — to know that for any act of mine, I shall get twice as much praise or twice as much blame. It is quite
exciting to hold the center of the national stage, with the spectators not knowing whether to laugh or to weep.
The position of my white neighbor is much more difficult. No brown specter pulls up a chair beside me when I sit down to eat. No dark ghost thrusts its leg against mine in bed.
The game of keeping what one has is never so exciting as the game of getting
I do not always feel colored. Even now I often achieve the unconscious Zora of Eatonville before the Hegira?
I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background.
For instance at Barnard. "Beside 10 the waters of the Hudson" I feel my race. Among the thousand white persons, I am a dark rock surged upon, and overswept, but through it all, I remain myself. When covered by the waters, I am; and the ebb but reveals me again.
Sometimes it is the other way around. A white person is set down in our midst, but the contrast is just as sharp for me. For instance, when I sit in the drafty basement that is The New World Cabaret with a white person, my color comes. We enter chatting about any little nothing that we have in common and are seated by the jazz waiters.
In the abrupt way that jazz orchestras have, this one plunges into a number. It loses no time in circumlocutions, but gets right down to business. It constricts the thorax and splits
the heart with its tempo and narcotic harmo-nies. This orchestra grows rambunctious, rears on its hind legs and attacks the tonal veil with primitive fury, rending it, clawing it until it breaks through to the jungle beyond.
I follow those heathen — follow them exult-ingly. I dance wildly inside myself; I yell
within, I whoop; I shake my assegai above my head, I hurl it true to the mark yeeeeooww! I am in the jungle and living in the jungle way.
My face is painted red and yellow and my body is painted blue. My pulse is throbbing like a war drum. I want to slaughter something — give pain, give death to what, I do not know. But the piece ends. The men of the orchestra wipe their lips and rest their fingers.
I creep back slowly to the veneer we call civilization with the last tone and find the white friend sitting motionless in his seat, smoking calmly.
"Good music they have here," he remarks, drumming the table with his fingertips.
Music. The great blobs of purple and red emotion have not touched him. He has only heard what I felt. He is far away and I see him but dimly across the ocean and the continent that have fallen between us. He is so pale with his whiteness then and I am so colored.
At certain times I have no race, I am me. When I set my hat at a certain angle and saunter down Seventh Avenue, Harlem City, feeling as snooty as the lions in front of the Forty-Second Street Library, for instance. So far as my feelings are concerned, Peggy Hopkins Joyce* on the Boule Mich' with her gorgeous raiment, stately carriage, knees knocking together in a most aristocratic manner, has nothing on me.
The cosmic Zora emerges. I belong to no race nor time. I am the eternal feminine with its string of beads.
Thave no separate feeling about being an American citizen and colored. I am merely a fragment of the Great Soul that surges within the boundaries. My country, right or wrong.
Sometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company? It's beyond me.
But in the main, I feel like a brown bag of miscellany propped against a wall. Against a wall in company with other bags, white, red, and yellow. Pour out the contents, and there is discovered a jumble of small things priceless and worthless. A first-water diamond, an empty spool, bits of broken glass, lengths of string, a key to a door long since crumbled away, a rusty knife-blade, old shoes saved for a road that never was and never will be, a nail bent under the weight of things too heavy for any nail, a dried flower or two still a little fra-grant. In your hand is the brown bag. On the ground before you is the jumble it held - so much like the jumble in the bags, could they be emptied, that all might be dumped in a single heap and the bags refilled without altering the content of any greatly. A bit of colored glass more or less would not matter. Perhaps that is how the Great Stuffer of Bags filled them in the first place — who

**Understanding and Interpreting the Rhetorical Situation**

1. In paragraph 5, Hurston's description, "I became a fast brown – warranted not to rub nor run," uses the language of paint or dye to describe her newly solidified racial identity.  The phrase "warranted not to rub nor run" suggests that this identity is fixed, indelible, and not something that can be easily changed or shed.  This conveys the stark reality of the shift she experienced: in Eatonville, her identity was simply "Zora," but in Jacksonville, race became a defining and inescapable aspect of her experience.  The "sea change" is not just geographic but a fundamental alteration in how she is perceived and how she perceives herself.

2. Hurston's attitude toward her racial identity and cultural background is complex.  She doesn't shy away from the realities of racism, but she refuses to be defined solely by it.  She acknowledges the impact of slavery on her ancestors but rejects the victim mentality, embracing her heritage as a source of strength and resilience.  The details in paragraphs 6-8 reveal her early life experiences in Eatonville—a place of freedom and acceptance—and the jarring contrast of her later experiences in Jacksonville, where she first fully confronts the realities of racial segregation.  Her argument is convincing because she uses personal anecdotes and vivid imagery to illustrate her points.  Her tone is both humorous and insightful, making her experience relatable even across the vastness of time and social context.

3. In paragraph 14, Hurston feels she has "no race" at times when she is able to transcend the limitations imposed by racial categorization.  She achieves a state of self-acceptance and self-possession that transcends the racial prejudice of the time.  When she writes, "the cosmic Zora emerges," she is referring to a universal, essential self that exists beyond racial boundaries.  This "cosmic Zora" is connected to a larger spiritual or existential reality, suggesting a sense of belonging that is not limited by the confines of race or societal expectations.

4. Hurston's audience seems to be a mixed one, including both Black and white readers familiar with the Harlem Renaissance. This is supported by her allusions to well-known aspects of Black culture (jazz, the Harlem Renaissance itself) and her direct engagement with the issue of racial identity in America.  Her sophisticated language and references suggest an educated readership.  The essay's publication in *The World Tomorrow*, a progressive magazine, also points to an audience interested in social and political issues.  Her informal and conversational tone, however, suggests an attempt to reach a broader, non-academic audience as well.

**Analyzing Language, Style, and Structure**

5. The word "veneer" in paragraph 11 suggests a superficial layer of civilization that masks a deeper, more primal reality.  Hurston's experience with jazz reveals the raw emotional power that lies beneath the surface of polite society.  She discovers a release and a sense of belonging in this primal expression that she doesn't find in the more restrained world of "civilization."

6. The first paragraph immediately establishes Hurston's unique and irreverent perspective.  It's a bold and witty opening that grabs the reader's attention and sets a playful yet serious tone. The self-deprecating humor immediately disarms the reader, inviting them into a conversation rather than presenting a formal argument.  Its effect is to make the reader curious and eager to learn more about this unconventional narrator.

7. The tone shifts from the confident self-assurance of paragraph 16 to a more reflective and introspective tone in paragraph 17.  In paragraph 16, Hurston celebrates her individuality and her ability to transcend racial boundaries.  In paragraph 17, she uses the metaphor of a brown bag of miscellany to portray the complexities of her identity and the shared human experience.  The shift reflects a movement from personal assertion to a broader consideration of the human condition.

**Composition**

8.  The thrill of the chase, the exhilaration of conquest, and the glory of achieving something great—these are the driving forces of human ambition, far outweighing the often tedious and unremarkable work of simply maintaining what one already possesses.  History is replete with examples of this: the mundane tasks of preserving a kingdom are rarely remembered, while the battles fought to *gain* that kingdom echo through the ages.  Consider the ancient world. We remember Alexander the Great's conquests, his relentless drive to expand his empire.  We don't dwell on the countless hours spent by his successors in merely administering the vast territories he acquired.  The Roman legions, famed for their military prowess and territorial expansion, are celebrated for their victories, not for the bureaucratic tasks of maintaining the empire's infrastructure.  Even the seemingly endless wars of the ancient Near East, fought over centuries for control of fertile lands and trade routes, are remembered for the dramatic battles, the heroic figures, and the shifting balance of power, not for the quotidian routines of governance and maintenance within established empires.  These examples demonstrate that the human spirit is captivated by the dynamism of "getting," by the struggle for achievement, more so than by the often monotonous process of "keeping." The act of acquisition, the challenge of overcoming obstacles, and the glory of triumph leave a far more indelible mark on history and the human psyche than the quiet perseverance of maintaining the status quo.  The mundane tasks of upkeep fade into the background; it's the bold strokes of achievement that command our attention and define our collective memory.
