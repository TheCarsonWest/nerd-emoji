7.  Use the excerpt below to answer the question: 

“Hetch Hetchy Valley, far from being a plain, common, rock-bound meadow, as many who have not seen it seem to suppose, is a grand landscape garden, one of Nature’s rarest and most precious mountain temples. . . . The sublime rocks of its walls seem to glow with life, whether leaning back in repose or standing erect in thoughtful attitudes, giving welcome to storms and calms alike, their brows in the sky, their feet set in the groves and gay flowery meadows, while birds, bees, and butterflies help the river and waterfalls to stir all the air into music. . . .

“This most precious and sublime feature of the Yosemite National Park, one of the greatest of all our natural resources for the uplifting joy and peace and health of the people, is in danger of being dammed and made into a reservoir to help supply San Francisco with water and light, thus flooding it from wall to wall and burying its gardens and groves one or two hundred feet deep. This grossly destructive commercial scheme has long been planned and urged . . . because of the comparative cheapness of the dam. . . .

“That anyone would try to destroy [Hetch Hetchy Valley] seems incredible; but sad experience shows that there are people good enough and bad enough for anything. The proponents of the dam scheme bring forward a lot of bad arguments to prove that the only righteous thing to do with the people’s parks is to destroy them bit by bit as they are able.”

John Muir, The Yosemite, published in 1912

Group of answer choices

The role of journalism in reform movements

The impact of segregation in the South

The challenges faced by immigrants settling in the West

The result of federal policies toward American Indian nations

**

The best answer is **The role of journalism in reform movements**. Here's why:

*   **The excerpt is a passionate argument against a specific action (damming Hetch Hetchy Valley) by John Muir, a prominent conservationist.** This reflects a reform movement aimed at preserving natural resources.

*   **Muir's writing, like many reformist writings, is intended to persuade public opinion and influence policy.** He uses vivid language and emotional appeals to make his case. This is a key element of how journalism and writing were used in reform movements.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **The impact of segregation in the South:** The excerpt focuses on environmental conservation, not racial segregation.
*   **The challenges faced by immigrants settling in the West:** While the setting is in the West, the core issue is about preserving a natural landscape, not immigration.
*   **The result of federal policies toward American Indian nations:** While environmental issues can sometimes intersect with Native American concerns, the excerpt's primary focus is on conservation and a specific damming project.
