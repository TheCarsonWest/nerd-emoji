**Similarities:**

* Both narratives describe a catastrophic, worldwide flood sent by a divine being(s) to punish humanity.
* Both involve a chosen individual (Utnapishtim/Noah) who is warned beforehand and instructed to build a vessel to survive the flood.
* Both involve the chosen individual taking family and animals aboard the vessel.
* Both stories describe the floodwaters receding, allowing survivors to repopulate the earth.
* Both involve offerings made by the survivors after the flood.

**Differences:**

The most significant differences lie in the motivations behind the floods, the nature of the divine beings involved, and the overall message conveyed.  The Gilgamesh flood presents a more ambivalent view of the gods, while the Genesis flood emphasizes God's justice and mercy, establishing a covenant with humanity.  The scale and details of the flood also differ, as do the rewards given to the survivors.
