**Definition:** A single replacement reaction is a chemical reaction in which one element replaces another element in a compound.

**General Equation:**

$$ A + BC → AC + B $$ * A is the element that replaces B
* B is the element that is replaced
* C is the common element in both compounds

**Reactivity Series:**

The reactivity of elements determines which element will replace another in a single replacement reaction. The reactivity series is a list of elements arranged in order of their decreasing reactivity. Elements at the top of the series are more reactive than those at the bottom.

**Predicting Products:**

To predict the products of a single replacement reaction, use the following rules:

* The more reactive element will replace the less reactive element in the compound.
* The element that is replaced will become the cation (positive ion) in the new compound.
* The element that replaces will become the anion (negative ion) in the new compound.

**Examples:**

* **Zinc and copper sulfate:**

$$ Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu $$ 
* **Iron and silver nitrate:**

$$ Fe + 2AgNO₃ → Fe(NO₃)₂ + 2Ag $$ 
* **Copper and hydrochloric acid:**

$$ Cu + 2HCl → CuCl₂ + H₂ $$ 
**Applications:**

Single replacement reactions are used in a variety of applications, including:

* **Electroplating:** A coating of one metal on another
* **Extraction of metals from ores:** Removing impurities from metals
* **Batteries:** Generating electricity
