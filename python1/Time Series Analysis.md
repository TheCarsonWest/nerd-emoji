## Time Series Analysis

### What is Time Series Analysis?
Time series analysis involves analyzing data collected at regular time intervals, known as time series data. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and dependencies within the data over time. It helps identify seasonality, detect outliers, forecast future values, and extract meaningful insights.

### How to Use Time Series Analysis
Python provides various libraries for time series analysis. The most popular are:
- Pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library with dedicated time series functions.
- Statsmodels: A statistical modeling library with time series-specific modules.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library with time series preprocessing and forecasting algorithms.

### Code Examples
```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create a time series from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv', index_col='date')

# Plot the time series
df['sales'].plot()
plt.show()

# Forecast future sales using an ARIMA model
from sklearn.linear_model import ARIMA

model = ARIMA(order=(5, 1, 0))
forecast = model.fit(df['sales']).predict(start=len(df), end=len(df) + 12)
```
