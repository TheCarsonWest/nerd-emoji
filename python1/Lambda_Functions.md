## Python Lambda Functions

### Explanation

Lambda functions in Python are anonymous functions that can be defined as an expression without using the `def` keyword. They are often used as short, one-line functions and are commonly used in functional programming and as callbacks.

### Parameters

Lambda functions have the following parameters:

* `parameters`: A comma-separated list of arguments that the function accepts.
* `expression`: The body of the function, which is evaluated to return a value.

### Syntax

The syntax of a lambda function is as follows:

```python
lambda parameters: expression
```

### Code Examples

**Example 1: Basic Lambda Function**

```python
# Function to square a number
square = lambda x: x * x
```

**Example 2: Lambda Function with Multiple Parameters**

```python
# Function to calculate the area of a triangle
area_triangle = lambda base, height: 0.5 * base * height
```

**Example 3: Lambda Function as a Callback**

```python
# Function to filter a list of numbers based on a condition
filtered_numbers = filter(lambda x: x > 5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
```

### Other Python Concepts Related to Lambda Functions

* **First-Class Functions:** Lambda functions can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned as results.
* **Anonymous Functions:** Lambda functions do not have a name, making them suitable for quick inline functions.
* **Functional Programming:** Lambda functions are a key component of functional programming, where functions are treated as objects.
* **Closures:** Lambda functions can access variables from their enclosing scope, creating closures.
* **Map and Filter:** Lambda functions are commonly used with the `map()` and `filter()` built-in functions for processing sequences.
* **List Comprehensions:** Lambda functions can be used as a concise way to implement list comprehensions.
