## [[Multidimensional [[Lists]]

### What are [[Multidimensional [[Lists]]?
Multidimensional [[Lists]] are data structures in Python that can store elements in multiple dimensions. They allow for the organization and representation of data with hierarchical structures. Unlike one-dimensional [[Lists]], which only have one level of elements, multidimensional [[Lists]] have multiple levels or dimensions.

### How to Use [[Multidimensional [[Lists]]
Multidimensional [[Lists]] are created using nested square brackets `[]`. Each dimension of the list is represented by a pair of square brackets, and elements are separated by commas. To access elements within a multidimensional list, use square brackets for each dimension of the list.

### Code Examples
```python
# create a 2-dimensional list
my_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

# Access an element from the first dimension
print(my_list[0][1]) # Output: 2

# Access an element from the second dimension
print(my_list[1][2]) # Output: 6
```

### Related Python Concepts

- [[Lists]]: Multidimensional [[Lists]] inherit properties and operations from one-dimensional [[Lists]].
- [[Tuples]]: Multidimensional [[Lists]] can be nested with [[Tuples]] for more complex data structures.
- [[Dictionaries]]: Multidimensional [[Lists]] can be used in conjunction with [[Dictionaries]] to create [[Dictionaries]] with multidimensional values.
- [[List Comprehension]]: [[List Comprehension]] can be used to create multidimensional [[Lists]] concisely.
- [[Generators]]: [[Generators]] can be used to create multidimensional [[Lists]] lazily, reducing memory usage.
