## [[Variables and Data Types]]

### What are [[Variables and Data Types]]?
Variables in Python are containers that store data. Each variable is associated with a data type, which defines the type of data it can hold (e.g., integer, float, string, list, etc.).

### How to Use Variables
To create a variable in Python, simply assign it a value:

```python
my_name = "John Doe"
```

## Data types:
Data types are the different ways. There are a lot of primitive data types and infinite non-primitive data types.
### Primitive data types
Primitive data types are those where the values are stored directly in memory. These are, by definition, the simplest ones.

Examples:
- Strings `name = 'John doe'`
	- Text
- Integers `i = 1`
	- whole numbers
- floats `pi = 3.14`
	- Numbers with a **float**-ing point(decimal point) 
- Booleans `thing = True`
	- true or false
### Non-primitive types
These are types that are stored as [[Classes and Objects]], you can usually do a few more things. Since you can make your own classes, there are infinite non-primitive types. 

Here are your important built-in non-primitives:
- Lists
- Arrays(same thing)
- Tuples(same thing)
- Dictionaries
- Files
### Code Examples
```python
# create an integer variable
age = 30
print(f"Age: {age}") # output: Age: 30

# create a float variable
pi = 3.14
print(f"Pi: {pi}") # output: Pi: 3.14

# create a string variable
name = "Mary"
print(f"Name: {name}") # output: Name: Mary
```

### Related Python Concepts

- [[Operators]]: [[Operators]] can be used to perform operations on variables of different data types.
- [[Control Flow If Statements]]: Variables and data types influence the flow of control in if statements based on the values stored in the variables.
- [[Functions]]: [[Functions]] can take arguments of specific data types and return values of specific types.
- [[Lists]]: [[Lists]] are mutable collections that can store a variety of data types.
- [[Dictionaries]]: [[Dictionaries]] are mutable collections that store key-value pairs, where the keys and values can be of different data types.
