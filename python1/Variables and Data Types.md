## [[Variables and Data Types]]

### What are [[Variables and Data Types]]?
Variables in Python are containers that store data. Each variable is associated with a data type, which defines the type of data it can hold (e.g., integer, float, string, list, etc.).

### How to Use Variables
To create a variable in Python, simply assign it a value:

```python
my_name = "John Doe"
```

The `type()` function can be used to check the data type of a variable:

```python
print(type(my_name))
```

### Code Examples
```python
# create an integer variable
age = 30
print(f"Age: {age}") # output: Age: 30

# create a float variable
pi = 3.14
print(f"Pi: {pi}") # output: Pi: 3.14

# create a string variable
name = "Mary"
print(f"Name: {name}") # output: Name: Mary
```

- [[Functions]]: [[Functions]] can take arguments of specific data types and return values of specific types.
- [[Lists]]: [[Lists]] are mutable collections that can store a variety of data types.
- [[Dictionaries]]: [[Dictionaries]] are mutable collections that store key-value pairs, where the keys and values can be of different data types.
