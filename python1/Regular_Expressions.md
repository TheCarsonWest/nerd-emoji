**Python Regular Expressions (Regex)**

**What is Regex?**

Regular expressions are a sequence of characters used to describe a pattern to be matched in a string. They provide a powerful way to search, modify, and validate strings based on complex patterns.

**Parameters**

* **Pattern:** The regular expression pattern to be matched.
* **Flags:** Optional flags that modify the behavior of the regex. Common flags include:
    * `re.IGNORECASE`: Ignore case
    * `re.MULTILINE`: Consider line breaks as boundaries
    * `re.DOTALL`: Match any character, including newlines
* **Target String:** The string to be searched or modified.

**Code Examples**

**Matching Patterns:**

```python
import re

# Match the word "Python"
pattern = "Python"
string = "Python is a programming language."
result = re.search(pattern, string)

if result:
    print("The word 'Python' was found.")
```

**Finding All Matches:**

```python
# Find all occurrences of the letter "a"
pattern = "a"
string = "This is a sample string."
result = re.findall(pattern, string)

print(result)  # ['a', 'a', 'a']
```

**Substituting Patterns:**

```python
# Replace all digits with "x"
pattern = r"\d+"  # Use raw string to prevent special character interpretation
string = "The number is 123456."
result = re.sub(pattern, "x", string)

print(result)  # The number is xxxxxx.
```

**Python Concepts Related to Regex**

* **String Methods:** Regular expressions can be used with string methods like `str.find()`, `str.replace()`, and `str.split()`.
* **re Module:** Python provides the `re` module for working with regular expressions.
* **Pattern Matching Objects:** Regex matching operations return pattern matching objects that provide information about the matched patterns.
* **Backreferences:** Regular expressions allow for backreferences, which refer to previously matched patterns.
