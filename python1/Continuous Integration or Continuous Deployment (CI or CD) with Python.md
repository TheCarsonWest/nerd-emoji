## Continuous Integration or Continuous Deployment (CI or CD) with Python

### What is it?
CI or CD in Python refers to practices that automate the software development lifecycle, from code versioning to testing, building, and deployment. These practices aim to improve the efficiency and reliability of software delivery.

### How to use it
**CI (Continuous Integration)**

* **Tools:** Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI
* **Process:**
 * Set up a CI tool in your project.
 * Create pipelines that define tasks to be executed automatically.
 * Tasks typically include:
 * Code analysis (e.g., [![Lint](Lint.md)](Lint.md))
 * Unit testing (e.g., [![Unit Testing]( [[Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development]].md)]( [[Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development]].md))
 * Integration testing (e.g., [![Selenium]( [[Automating Tasks with Selenium]].md)]( [[Automating Tasks with Selenium]].md))
 * Trigger pipelines automatically on code changes or at scheduled intervals.

**CD (Continuous Deployment)**

* **Tools:** Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, Azure Pipelines
* **Process:**
 * Extend the CI pipeline to include deployment tasks.
 * Tasks typically include:
 * Building the application (e.g., [! [[Creating GUI Applications with Tkinter or PyQt]]( [[Creating GUI Applications with Tkinter or PyQt]].md)]( [[Creating GUI Applications with Tkinter or PyQt]].md))
 * Deploying to staging environments (e.g., [![AWS CodePipeline](AWS CodePipeline.md)](AWS CodePipeline.md))
 * Monitoring live deployments (e.g., [! [[Profiling and Optimization]]( [[Profiling and Optimization]].md)]( [[Profiling and Optimization]].md))
 * Automatically deploy changes to live environments once they pass all CI checks.

### Code Examples
**CI Pipeline**
```python
# GitHub Actions pipeline file
name: Continuous Integration

on:
 push:
 branches: [ main ]

jobs:
 build:
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest
 steps:
 - uses: actions/checkout@v3
 - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
 with:
 python-version: '3.10'
 - run: pip install my_package
 - run: pytest
```

**CD Pipeline**
```python
# Azure Pipelines pipeline file
stages:
- Stage 1
- Stage 2

jobs:
- job: Build
 stage: Stage 1
 steps:
 - task: BuildPythonPackage@1
 inputs:
 pythonVersion: '3.10'
 script: 'python setup.py sdist'
- job: Deploy
 stage: Stage 2
 dependsOn: Build
 steps:
 - task: AzureAppServiceDeploy@4
 inputs:
 azureSubscription: 'my-subscription'
 appName: 'my-app'
 package: '$(Build.Artifact)'
```
