## REST APIs with FastAPI

### What are FastAPI REST APIs?
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building RESTful APIs in Python. It offers features such as automatic type hinting, dependency injection, and support for asynchronous programming. REST APIs are web services that follow the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, using a set of request methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) to interact with data.

### How to Use FastAPI
To create a REST API with FastAPI, you can follow these steps:

1. Install FastAPI using pip: `pip install fastapi`
2. Create a Python file to define your API routes and data models.
3. Use `@app.get`, `@app.post`, `@app.put`, or `@app.delete` decorators to define the API routes and HTTP methods.
4. Use FastAPI data models to define the data structures that your API will handle.
5. Run the API using `uvicorn main:app`, replacing `main` with the name of your Python file.

### Code Examples
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def get_item(item_id: int):
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

### Related Python Concepts

- [[Modules and Packages]]: FastAPI is a Python module, and you need to import it to use its features.
- [[Functions]]: FastAPI routes are defined using function decorators.
- [[Type Hinting]]: FastAPI supports type hinting for data models and function parameters.
- [[Asynchronous Programming]]: FastAPI supports asynchronous programming, allowing for more efficient and scalable APIs.
- [[Importing Modules]]: You need to import the FastAPI module to use it in your Python code.
