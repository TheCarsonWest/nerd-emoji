## [[Bitwise [[Operators]]

### What are [[Bitwise [[Operators]]?
Bitwise [[Operators]] perform operations on the binary representations of integers. They allow manipulation of individual bits, providing precise control over the binary-level details of data.

### How to Use [[Bitwise [[Operators]]
Bitwise [[Operators]] are represented by symbols that indicate the specific operation to be performed on the bits of the operands. The operands must be integers or bitwise expressions. The result is a new integer that represents the modified binary value.

### Common [[Bitwise [[Operators]]

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `&` | AND | Performs a bitwise AND operation, returning 1 if both bits are 1, and 0 otherwise | `5 & 3 = 1` (0101 & 0011 = 0001) |
| `|` | OR | Performs a bitwise OR operation, returning 1 if either bit is 1 | `5 | 3 = 7` (0101 | 0011 = 0111) |
| `^` | XOR | Performs a bitwise XOR operation, returning 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same | `5 ^ 3 = 6` (0101 ^ 0011 = 0110) |
| `~` | NOT | Performs a bitwise NOT operation, flipping 0s to 1s and vice versa | `~5 = -6` (0101 -> 1010) |
| `<<` | Left Shift | Shifts the bits to the left, multiplying by 2<sup>n</sup>, where n is the number of positions shifted | `5 << 2 = 20` (0101 << 2 = 10100) |
| `>>` | Right Shift | Shifts the bits to the right, dividing by 2<sup>n</sup>, where n is the number of positions shifted | `20 >> 2 = 5` (10100 >> 2 = 0101) |
