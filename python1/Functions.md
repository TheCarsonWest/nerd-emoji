## Python Functions

**What is a Function?**

* A block of code that performs a specific task.
* It can be reused multiple times without rewriting the code.

**Parameters**

* Parameters are values that are passed to a function.
* They act as input to the function.

**Code Examples**

**Creating a Function:**

```python
def greet(name):
    """Prints a greeting to the specified name."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

**Calling a Function:**

```python
greet("John")
```

**Returning Values:**

```python
def sum(a, b):
    """Returns the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b
```

**Other Python Concepts Linked to Functions**

* **Scope:** Variables defined inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of it.
* **Arguments:** Actual values passed to a function when it is called.
* **Keywords:** Used to pass named arguments to a function.
* **Lambda Functions:** Anonymous functions that can be used as inline expressions.
* **Function Annotations:** Type hints that indicate the expected input and output types of a function.
