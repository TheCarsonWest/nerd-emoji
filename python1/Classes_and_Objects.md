**Python [[Classes_and_Objects]]**

**Introduction**

In Python, [[Classes]] are blueprints for creating [[Objects]]. An [[Object]] is a real-world entity that has properties and methods. [[Classes]] define the structure and behavior of [[Objects]].

**What is a [[Class]]?**

* A [[Class]] is a collection of data and methods that operate on that data.
* It defines the common attributes and behaviors of a group of [[Objects]].
* It serves as a template for creating new [[Objects]].

**Parameters of a [[Class]]:**

* **Name:** The name of the [[Class]], which should start with a capital letter.
* **Attributes:** Properties or characteristics of the [[Object]].
* **Methods:** Functions or actions that can be performed on the [[Object]].
* **Constructor:** A special method that initializes the [[Object]] when it is created.

**How to Create a [[Class]]:**

```python
[[Class]] MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name, age):  # Constructor
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def get_name(self):  # Method
        return self.name

    def get_age(self):  # Method
        return self.age
```

**Creating [[Objects]] from a [[Class]]:**

```python
my_[[object]] = MyClass("John", 30)
print(my_[[object]].get_name())  # Outputs "John"
print(my_[[object]].get_age())  # Outputs 30
```

**Other Concepts Related to [[Classes]] and [[Objects]]:**

* [[Inheritance]]: Creating a subclass from an existing [[Class]]. The subclass inherits the attributes and methods of the superclass.
* [[Encapsulation]]: Hiding data and logic within a [[Class]] to control access and prevent data modification from unauthorized code.
* [[Polymorphism]]: Different [[Objects]] of different [[Classes]] can be treated as [[Objects]] of the same superclass.
* [[Abstraction]]: Creating [[Classes]] that represent concepts without revealing their implementation details.

**Code Examples:**

```python
**Example [[Class]]:**

[[Class]] Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species

    def make_sound(self):
        print("The animal makes a sound.")

**Example [[Object]] Creation:**

animal1 = Animal("Fluffy", "Cat")
animal2 = Animal("Buddy", "Dog")

**Example Method Invocation:**

animal1.make_sound()  # Outputs "The animal makes a sound."
animal2.make_sound()  # Outputs "The animal makes a sound."
```

**Conclusion:**

[[Classes]] and [[Objects]] are fundamental concepts in Python programming. They allow us to organize code, create reusable data structures, and model real-world entities. Understanding these concepts is essential for building robust and maintainable Python applications.
