## Lambda [[Functions]]

### Explanation
Lambda functions in Python are small, anonymous functions that can be defined without using the `def` keyword. They are often used as inline functions when passing a function as an argument to another function or as a way to quickly define a simple function.

### How to Use Lambda [[Functions]]
Lambda functions take the following format:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

* **arguments**: The input parameters to the function.
* **expression**: The code to be executed when the function is called.

### Code Examples
```python
# define a lambda function to calculate the square of a number
square = lambda x: x ** 2

# call the lambda function
print(square(5)) # Output: 25
```

```python
# use a lambda function as an argument to the `sort` function
numbers = [5, 1, 3, 2, 4]
numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x % 2) # sort the numbers based on their remainder when divided by 2
print(numbers) # Output: [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
```

### Related Python Concepts
- [[Functions]]: Lambda functions are essentially simplified versions of regular functions.
- [[Function Parameters]]: Lambda functions can receive arguments just like regular functions.
- [[Higher-Order [[Functions]]: Lambda functions are often used as arguments to higher-order functions.
- [[Closures]]: Lambda functions can access variables from the enclosing scope, creating closures.
- [[Map, Filter, and Reduce]]: Lambda functions commonly appear in these built-in functions.
