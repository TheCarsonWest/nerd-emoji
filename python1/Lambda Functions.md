## Python [[Lambda Functions]]

### Explanation

[[Lambda Functions]] in Python are anonymous functions that can be defined as an expression without using the `def` keyword. They are often used as short, one-line functions and are commonly used in functional programming and as callbacks.

### Parameters

[[Lambda Functions]] have the following parameters:

* `parameters`: A comma-separated list of arguments that the function accepts.
* `expression`: The body of the function, which is evaluated to return a value.

### Syntax

The syntax of a [[Lambda_Function]] is as follows:

```python
lambda parameters: expression
```

### Code Examples

**Example 1: Basic [[Lambda_Function]]**

```python
# Function to square a number
square = lambda x: x * x
```

**Example 2: [[Lambda_Function]] with Multiple Parameters**

```python
# Function to calculate the area of a triangle
area_triangle = lambda base, height: 0.5 * base * height
```

**Example 3: [[Lambda_Function]] as a Callback**

```python
# Function to filter a list of numbers based on a condition
filtered_numbers = filter(lambda x: x > 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
```

### Other Python Concepts Related to [[Lambda Functions]]

* **[[First-Class_Functions]]:** [[Lambda Functions]] can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned as results.
* **[[Anonymous_Functions]]:** [[Lambda Functions]] do not have a name, making them suitable for quick inline functions.
* **[[Functional_Programming]]:** [[Lambda Functions]] are a key component of functional programming, where functions are treated as objects.
* **[[Closures]]:** [[Lambda Functions]] can access variables from their enclosing scope, creating closures.
* **[[Map and Filter]]:** [[Lambda Functions]] are commonly used with the `map()` and `filter()` built-in functions for processing sequences.
* [[List Comprehension]]: [[Lambda Functions]] can be used as a concise way to implement list comprehensions.
