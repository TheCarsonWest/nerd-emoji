## [[Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development]]

### What is [[Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development]]?
Unit testing is a methodology for testing individual units of code, typically functions or methods, to ensure their correct functionality. Test-driven development (TDD) is an agile development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code, ensuring that the code meets the requirements from the outset.

### How to Use Unit Testing in Python
Python's unit testing framework, `unittest`, provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating and running tests. Here's how to use it:

**1. Create a Test Case Class:**
```python
import unittest

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
 # Define unit tests in methods like `test_function`
```

**2. Define Unit Tests:**
Unit tests should follow a specific naming convention: `test_function` for testing a function named `function`.
```python
 def test_function(self):
 # Perform unit test
 # Assert the expected results using assert methods
```

**3. Run the Tests:**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
 unittest.main()
```

### How to Use Test-Driven Development with Unit Testing
TDD involves the following steps:

**1. Write a Test:**
Before implementing any code, write a test that describes the expected behavior of the code you intend to write.

**2. Run the Test:**
Run the test to ensure it fails, indicating the absence of the required code.

**3. Write Code:**
Implement the code that fulfills the requirements specified in the test.

**4. Run the Test Again:**
Run the test again to verify that it now passes, confirming the correct implementation of the code.

### Related Python Concepts

- [[Functions]]: Unit tests primarily target functions or methods.
- [[Modules and Packages]]: Unit tests can be organized into separate files as modules or packages.
- [[Exceptions]]: Unit tests can check for the correct handling of exceptions.
- [[Mocks]]: Unit tests often use mocks to simulate the behavior of external dependencies.
- [[Type Hinting]]: Type hints in test functions help ensure the correct types of inputs and outputs.
