## [[Handling Large Datasets with Dask]]

### What is Dask?
- A Python library designed specifically for handling large, out-of-core datasets.
- Provides distributed computing capabilities, enabling parallel processing across multiple cores or machines.
- Supports a wide range of operations, including data manipulation, aggregation, and machine learning algorithms.

### How to Use Dask
- Dask offers various functions and data structures for working with large datasets.

### Code Examples
- Creating a Dask dataframe from a local CSV file:
```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

df = dd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv')
```

- Perform a groupby operation on a Dask dataframe:
```python
df_grouped = df.groupby('group_column')
```

### Related Python Concepts
- [[Libraries like Pandas]]: Dask dataframe objects are similar to Pandas dataframes, but optimized for large datasets.
- [[Distributed Computing]]: Dask leverages distributed computing to parallelize operations.
- [[Concurrency and Multithreading]]: Dask utilizes threads and processes for concurrent execution.
- [[DataFrames in Pandas]]: Dask dataframes extend the functionality of Pandas dataframes for large datasets.
- [[Working with Big Data using PySpark]]: PySpark and Dask are both frameworks for handling large-scale data.
