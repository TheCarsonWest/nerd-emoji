## [[Thread Safety]]

### What is [[Thread Safety]]?
Thread safety refers to the ability of a code block or object to be safely executed by multiple threads simultaneously without causing unpredictable behavior or data corruption. In other words, thread-safe code ensures that the outcome of a computation is the same regardless of how many threads are accessing it.

### How to Use [[Thread Safety]]
Thread safety can be achieved in Python using various approaches:

**1. Locks:** Locks are synchronization primitives that allow only one thread to access a critical section of code at a time. This prevents other threads from interfering with the execution of the critical section.

```python
import threading

# create a lock object
lock = threading.Lock()

# use the lock to protect critical section
with lock:
 # critical section code
```

**2. Thread-Local Storage (TLS):** TLS allows each thread to maintain a separate copy of a variable. This ensures that data accessed by one thread will not be modified by another thread.

```python
import threading

# create a thread-local storage object
thread_local = threading.local()

# set a thread-local variable
thread_local.data = 10

# access the thread-local variable
data = thread_local.data
```

**3. Atomic Operations:** Atomic operations are indivisible operations that are guaranteed to execute completely or not at all. This prevents partial execution of an operation by multiple threads, which could lead to data corruption.

```python
import atomic

# create an atomic counter
counter = atomic.AtomicCounter()

# increment the counter using atomic operation
counter.inc()
```

### Code Examples
```python
# using a lock to protect a shared resource
import threading

class Counter:
 def __init__(self):
 self.count = 0
 self.lock = threading.Lock()

 def increment(self):
 # acquire the lock before accessing shared resource
 with self.lock:
 self.count += 1
```

```python
# using thread-local storage to store thread-specific data
import threading

def thread_function():
 # access thread-local variable
 data = thread_local.data

 # perform thread-specific computation

# create a thread-local storage object
thread_local = threading.local()
```

- [[Locks]]: Locks are essential for achieving thread safety by controlling access to critical sections.
- [[Multiprocessing]]: [[Multiprocessing]] offers an alternative to threads for parallel execution, but thread safety considerations still apply.
- [[Synchronization]]: Thread safety requires proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure that multiple threads can access shared resources without conflict.
- [[Asynchronous Programming]]: Asynchronous programming techniques can help avoid thread safety issues by leveraging event-based execution models.
