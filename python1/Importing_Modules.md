## Python Importing_Modules

Importing modules is a way of reusing code that has already been written. Modules can be created by you or by others and shared. They can contain functions, classes, and other objects.

To import a module, you use the import statement. The import statement takes the name of the module as an argument. For example, to import the math module, you would use the following statement:

```python
import math
```

Once you have imported a module, you can access its contents using the dot operator. For example, to access the pi constant from the math module, you would use the following expression:
```python
math.pi
```

Modules can also be imported with specific names. This can be useful if you want to avoid name conflicts with other modules or objects in your program. To import a module with a specific name, you use the as keyword. For example, to import the math module with the name m, you would use the following statement:

```python
import math as m
```

You can also import specific objects from a module. To do this, you use the from statement. The from statement takes the name of the module and the names of the objects you want to import as arguments. For example, to import the pi constant from the math module, you would use the following statement:

```python
from math import pi
```

Modules can be used to organize your code and make it easier to reuse. They can also help you to avoid name conflicts and make your code more readable.

Here are some additional notes on importing modules:

* Modules can be imported multiple times.
* Modules can import other modules.
* Modules can be created in any directory.
* Modules can be stored in zip files.
* Modules can be installed using the pip package manager.

**Other Python concepts that link back to this one:**

* Packages
* Classes
* Functions
* Objects
* Name conflicts
