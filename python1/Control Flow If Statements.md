# [[Control Flow If Statements]]

## What are If Statements?
If statements are a foundational control flow construct in Python that allow the conditional execution of one or more code blocks based on a Boolean condition. They enable decisions and alter the flow of a program.

## How to Use If Statements
The syntax of an if statement in Python is:

```python
if condition:
 # code block to be executed if condition is True
```

The `condition` is typically a comparison expression that evaluates to either True or False. If the condition is True, the code block under the if statement will be executed. Otherwise, the execution will skip to the next statement after the if statement.

## Code Examples
```python
# check if the value of x is greater than 5
if x > 5:
 print("x is greater than 5")
```

```python
# check if the user is an administrator
if user_is_admin():
 # allow access to sensitive data
 pass
```

## Related Python Concepts

- [[Variables and Data Types]]: If statements rely on Boolean data types to evaluate conditions.
- [[Operators]]: Comparison operators like `>` and `==` are used to create conditions in if statements.
- [[Functions]]: If statements can be used to conditionally call functions.
- [[For Loops]]: If statements can be used to control the execution of for loops.
- [[While Loops]]: If statements can be used to terminate or continue the execution of while loops.
