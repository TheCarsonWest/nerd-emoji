## [[Metaclasses]]

### What are [[Metaclasses]]?
[[Metaclasses]] are classes that create other classes. They provide a way to modify the behavior of classes at the time of their creation. This allows for advanced customization and control over the creation and behavior of objects.

### How to Use [[Metaclasses]]
[[Metaclasses]] are defined using the `type` keyword, followed by the metaclass name, the tuple of base classes, and the class body. The body of a metaclass typically contains methods that modify the behavior of the class being created.

```python
class MyMetaclass(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        # modify the class being created
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)
```

The `__new__` method is the most commonly overridden method in metaclasses. It is called when a new class is created and provides an opportunity to modify the class before it is returned.

### Code Examples
```python
class MyMetaclass(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        attrs['foo'] = 'bar'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMetaclass):
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.foo)  # prints 'bar'
```
