## [[Tuples]]

### What are [[Tuples]]?
[[Tuples]] are immutable data structures in Python that store ordered sequences of elements. Unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified after creation. They are represented by parentheses `()`.

### How to Use [[Tuples]]
[[Tuples]] are created by enclosing elements in parentheses, separated by commas. Elements can be of any Python data type.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```

### Code Examples
```python
# create a tuple of numbers
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# create a tuple of mixed data types
mixed_tuple = ("John", 30, True)

# access elements of a tuple
print(numbers[0])  # output: 1

# use unpacking to assign tuple elements to variables
x, y, z = numbers  # equivalent to x = numbers[0], y = numbers[1], z = numbers[2]
```
