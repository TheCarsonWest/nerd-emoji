## Python [[Dictionaries]]

### Definition
 [[Dictionaries]] are mutable data structures that store key-value pairs. The keys are unique and immutable, while the values can be of any type. [[Dictionaries]] provide a convenient way to store and retrieve data associated with specific keys.

### How to Use [[Dictionaries]]
```python
# create a dictionary using the {} syntax
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}

# access a value using the key
value = my_dict["key1"]
```

### Code Examples
```python
# create a dictionary of student names and ages
students = {"Alice": 20, "Bob": 25, "Carol": 22}

# add a new student
students["Dave"] = 28

# delete a student
del students["Bob"]

# loop through the dictionary
for name, age in students.items():
 print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
```

### Related Python Concepts

- [[Variables and Data Types]]: [[Dictionaries]] are stored as variables and can contain different data types.
- [[Lists]]: [[Lists]] and dictionaries are both sequence data structures, but lists are ordered and mutable while dictionaries are unordered and mutable.
- [[Tuples]]: [[Tuples]] and dictionaries are both mutable data structures, but tuples are immutable.
- [[Python Sets]]: [[Python Sets]] are similar to dictionaries but only store unique keys.
- [[Functions]]: [[Functions]] can be used to create and modify dictionaries.
