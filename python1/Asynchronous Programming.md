## [[Asynchronous Programming]]

### What is [[Asynchronous Programming]]?
Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows tasks to be executed concurrently without blocking the main thread. It is particularly useful when working with I/O-intensive operations, such as network requests or file system operations, as it enables efficient utilization of system resources and reduces latency.

### How to Use [[Asynchronous Programming]]
Utilizing asynchronous programming in Python primarily involves employing asyncio module. Here's an overview of the module's core components:

- ** [[Coroutines]]:** [[Coroutines]] are cooperative multitasking functions that can be suspended and resumed.
- **Events:** Events are objects that represent the completion of an asynchronous operation.
- **Tasks:** Tasks are objects that represent and manage [[Coroutines]] concurrently.

### Code Examples
```python
# Initiate an asynchronous task to fetch a URL
import asyncio

async def fetch_url(url):
 async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
 async with session.get(url) as response:
 return await response.text()

asyncio.run(fetch_url("https://example.com"))
```

### Related Python Concepts

- [[Coroutines]]: [[Coroutines]] are the fundamental building blocks of asynchronous programming in Python.
- [[Events]]: Events are used to synchronize the execution of asynchronous tasks.
- [[Tasks]]: Tasks provide a mechanism for managing and executing [[Coroutines]] concurrently.
- [[Concurrency and Multithreading]]: Asynchronous programming is an alternative approach to [[Concurrency and Multithreading]].
- [[Generators]]: [[Generators]] are similar to [[Coroutines]], but they do not support suspension and resumption.
