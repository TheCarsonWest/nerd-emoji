## Security and Cryptography (PyCryptodome)

### What is PyCryptodome?
PyCryptodome is a Python module that provides a robust set of cryptographic algorithms and protocols for secure communication and data protection. It offers various encryption, decryption, hashing, and digital signature capabilities, enabling developers to implement secure features in their Python applications.

### Usage

PyCryptodome includes a wide range of cryptographic [[Python Functions]], each with specific parameters and usage. Here are some common [[Python Functions]] and their parameters:

- **encrypt()**: Encrypts data using a specified algorithm and key. It takes the plaintext, key, and padding scheme as parameters.
 - `plaintext`: The original data to be encrypted.
 - `key`: The encryption key used to protect the data.
 - `padding`: The padding scheme to use (e.g., PKCS7).
- **decrypt()**: Decrypts encrypted data using a specified algorithm and key. It takes the ciphertext, key, and padding scheme as parameters, analogous to the `encrypt()` function.
- **hash()**: Computes a hash digest of data using a specified algorithm (e.g., SHA-256). It takes the data and algorithm as parameters.
 - `data`: The input data to be hashed.
 - `algorithm`: The hash algorithm (e.g., `sha256` or `sha512`).
- **sign()**: Generates a digital signature for data using a specified private key. It takes the data, private key, and hash algorithm as parameters.
 - `data`: The data to be signed.
 - `private_key`: The private key used for signing.
 - `hash_algorithm`: The hash algorithm used to compute the signature.
- **verify()**: Verifies a digital signature using a specified public key. It takes the data, signature, public key, and hash algorithm as parameters.
 - `data`: The original data that was signed.
 - `signature`: The digital signature generated by `sign()`.
 - `public_key`: The public key used to verify the signature.
 - `hash_algorithm`: The hash algorithm used to compute the signature.

### Code Examples

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

# Encrypt a message using AES encryption
key = b'my_secret_key'
plaintext = b'Hello, world!'
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)

# Decrypt the encrypted message
decryptedtext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
print(decryptedtext.decode())
```

```python
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

# Compute a SHA-256 hash digest of a message
message = b'This is my message'
hash = SHA256.new(message)
digest = hash.digest()
print(digest.hex())
```
