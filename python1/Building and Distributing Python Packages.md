## [[Building and Distributing Python Packages]]

### What are Python Packages?
Python packages are a way to organize and distribute reusable code in Python. They encapsulate related modules, classes, and other resources into a single unit that can be easily installed and used in other Python programs.

### How to Build a Python Package
To create a package, create a directory with the name of your package. Inside this directory, create one or more Python modules (files with a `.py` extension) that contain your code.

To define a package, create a file named `__init__.py` in the package directory. This file can be empty or contain code to initialize the package.

### How to Distribute a Python Package
To distribute your package, you can use the Python Package Index ([[Python Package Index (PyPI) Publishing]]) or other package repositories. To publish your package on PyPI, follow these steps:

1. Create a PyPI account.
2. Create a setup script (usually named `setup.py`) in your package directory.
3. Register your package with PyPI using the `twine` tool:
 ```
 twine register dist/PACKAGE_NAME-VERSION_NUMBER.tar.gz
 ```

### Other Python Concepts Related to Packages
- [[Modules and Packages]]: Packages are a higher-level organization of modules.
- [[Importing Modules]]: Packages can be imported using the `import` statement.
- [[Virtual Environments]]: Packages can be installed and used within virtual environments.
- [[Dynamic Importing]]: Packages can be imported dynamically at runtime.
- [[Command Line Interface (CLI) Programs]]: Packages can be used to create command-line tools.
