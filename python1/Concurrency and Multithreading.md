## [[Concurrency and Multithreading]]

### What is [[Concurrency and Multithreading]]?
Concurrency and multithreading in Python refer to the ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously within a single Python program. This allows for improved performance and efficiency by utilizing multiple cores or processors available on a computing system.

### How to Use Multithreading
Python's `threading` module provides functionality for multithreading. Here's how to use it:

- Create a new thread: `thread = threading.Thread(target=function, args=(arg1, arg2))`
- Start the thread: `thread.start()`
- Join the thread (wait for it to complete): `thread.join()`
- `function`: The function to be executed in the new thread
- `args`: Arguments to be passed to the function

### Code Examples
```python
import threading

def print_hello():
 print("Hello from a thread!")

thread = threading.Thread(target=print_hello)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

### Related Python Concepts

- [[Functions]]: Multithreading involves creating and executing functions in separate threads.
- [[Modules and Packages]]: The `threading` module is a pre-built module in Python that provides functions and classes for multithreading.
- [[Concurrency and Multithreading]]: This topic is directly related to concurrency and multithreading in Python.
- [[Multiprocessing]]: [[Multiprocessing]] is another approach for parallel execution, involving the creation of separate processes instead of threads.
- [[Asynchronous Programming]]: Asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking I/O operations, which can be useful for concurrency.
