## [[Custom [[Context Managers]]

### What are [[Custom [[Context Managers]]?
Custom [[Context Managers]] provide a way to define a block of code that should be executed before and after a specific operation. They are used to automate resource management tasks, such as opening and closing files or acquiring and releasing locks.

### How to Use [[Custom [[Context Managers]]
To create a custom context manager, you need to define a class that implements the __enter__ and __exit__ methods. The __enter__ method is called when the context manager is entered, and the __exit__ method is called when the context manager is exited (regardless of whether an exception was raised).

The __enter__ method should return an object that will be bound to the target variable within the context manager block. The __exit__ method takes three arguments: the exception type, value, and traceback, and should handle any necessary cleanup or resource release.

### Code Examples
```python
class MyContextManager:
 def __enter__(self):
 # do something before the operation
 return obj

 def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback):
 # do something after the operation, even if an exception occurred
 pass

with MyContextManager() as obj:
 # do something with obj
 # __exit__ will be called automatically after this block
```
