**Python Encapsulation**

**Definition:**
Encapsulation is a software development principle that restricts access to data and methods within an object, making them only accessible through predefined interfaces. It serves to protect the internal state of the object and ensure data integrity.

**Parameters:**

* **Public:** Accessible to all objects within the program.
* **Protected:** Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
* **Private:** Accessible only within the class itself.

**Code Examples:**

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name  # Private attribute
        self._age = age    # Protected attribute

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name  # Access private attribute

    def set_age(self, new_age):
        self._age = new_age  # Access protected attribute
```

**Related Python Concepts:**

* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, where objects encapsulate data and behavior.
* **Abstract Methods:** Abstract methods have no implementation and must be overridden in subclasses. This allows for polymorphic behavior while maintaining encapsulation.
* **Overloading:** Encapsulation can prevent method overloading, as private methods within the same class are not exposed to other objects.
* **Polymorphism:** Encapsulation ensures that subclass methods have access to protected and private properties of their superclass, supporting polymorphic behavior.
* **Modularity:** Encapsulation promotes modularity by grouping related data and methods within classes, making it easier to manage and maintain code.
