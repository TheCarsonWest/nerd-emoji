## Method Resolution Order (MRO)

### Explanation
MRO in Python refers to the order in which methods are searched and inherited by subclasses. It determines which implementation of a method from a superclass will be used when a subclass has multiple possible implementations.

### How to Use It
Python calculates the MRO automatically based on the class hierarchy. There is no direct way to modify or override it.

### Code Examples
Consider the following class hierarchy:

```python
class A:
 def method(self):
 print("Method from class A")

class B(A):
 def method(self):
 print("Method from class B")

class C(B):
 pass
```

In this example, the MRO for class `C` is `[C, B, A]` (from most derived to least derived). When calling `method` on an instance of class `C`, the interpreter will first look for a `method` method in `C`. If it's not found, it will proceed up the MRO, checking `B` and then `A`. This ensures that the most specific implementation of the method is used.

### Related Python Concepts
- [[Classes and Objects]]: MRO is used to resolve method inheritance in class hierarchies.
- [[Inheritance]]: MRO defines the order in which inherited methods are searched.
- [[Polymorphism]]: MRO enables the use of different implementations of the same method in subclasses.
- [[Multiple [[Inheritance]]: MRO is particularly important in managing method conflicts in multiple inheritance scenarios.
- [[Method Overloading]]: MRO helps resolve ambiguity when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters.
