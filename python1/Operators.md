## Python [[Operators]]

### What are [[Operators]]?
[[Operators]] are special symbols or functions that perform specific operations on values. They allow the manipulation, comparison, and modification of data in Python.

### How to Use [[Operators]]
[[Operators]] can be used in expressions along with variables, values, and other operators. The result of an operation depends on the types of operands and the operator itself.

### Types of [[Operators]]

Python operators can be classified into various types:

- **Arithmetic [[Operators]]:** Perform mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulo (%).
- **Assignment [[Operators]]:** Assign values to variables (e.g., =, +=, -=, *=, /=).
- **Comparison [[Operators]]:** Compare values and return a Boolean (e.g., ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=).
- **Logical [[Operators]]:** Combine Boolean values using AND (&), OR (|), and NOT (~).
- **[[Bitwise [[Operators]]:** Perform bitwise operations on integers (e.g., &, |, ^, <<, >>).
- **Unary [[Operators]]:** Perform operations on a single operand (e.g., +, -, ~).
- **Membership [[Operators]]:** Check if an element is present in a sequence (e.g., in, not in).
- **Identity [[Operators]]:** Compare object identities (e.g., is, is not).

### Code Examples

```python
# Arithmetic operator: add 10 to x
x + 10
```

```python
# Assignment operator: assign 5 to y
y = 5
```

```python
# Comparison operator: check if x equals 10
x == 10
```

```python
# Logical operator: check if x is greater than 0 and y is less than 10
(x > 0) and (y < 10)
```
