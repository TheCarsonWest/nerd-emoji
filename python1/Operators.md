**Python Operators**

**What are Python Operators?**

Python operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables, values, or expressions. They determine how to combine, compare, or manipulate data to produce a result.

**Types of Python Operators**

**1. Arithmetic Operators:** Used for mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
   - + (addition)
   - - (subtraction)
   - * (multiplication)
   - / (division)
   - % (modulus)
   - ** (exponentiation)

**2. Comparison Operators:** Used to compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False).
   - == (equals)
   - != (not equals)
   - > (greater than)
   - < (less than)
   - >= (greater than or equal to)
   - <= (less than or equal to)

**3. Logical Operators:** Used to combine Boolean values and perform logical operations.
   - and (logical AND)
   - or (logical OR)
   - not (logical NOT)

**4. Assignment Operators:** Used to assign values to variables.
   - = (assignment)
   - += (addition assignment)
   - -= (subtraction assignment)
   - *= (multiplication assignment)
   - /= (division assignment)

**5. Bitwise Operators:** Used to perform bitwise operations on integers.
   - & (bitwise AND)
   - | (bitwise OR)
   - ^ (bitwise XOR)
   - ~ (bitwise NOT)
   - << (bitwise left shift)
   - >> (bitwise right shift)

**6. Membership Operators:** Used to check if a value is present in a sequence or not.
   - in (membership)
   - not in (non-membership)

**7. Identity Operators:** Used to compare two objects for identity.
   - is (identity)
   - is not (non-identity)

**Code Examples**

```python
# Arithmetic Operators
x = 5 + 3  # Addition
y = 10 - 2  # Subtraction
z = 4 * 5  # Multiplication
a = 15 / 3  # Division
b = 10 % 3  # Modulus
c = 2 ** 3  # Exponentiation

# Comparison Operators
print(5 == 5)  # True
print(10 != 20)  # True
print(15 > 10)  # True
print(3 < 5)  # True
print(12 >= 12)  # True
print(4 <= 2)  # False

# Logical Operators
print(True and False)  # False
print(True or False)  # True
print(not True)  # False

# Assignment Operators
x = 10
x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5
x -= 3  # Equivalent to x = x - 3
```

**Other Related Python Concepts**

* **Variables:** Used to store values and refer to them in code.
* **Data Types:** Different types of data that Python can handle, such as numbers, strings, and lists.
* **Expressions:** Combinations of variables, operators, and values that evaluate to a single value.
* **Boolean Logic:** The concept of true and false values used in comparison and logical operations.
