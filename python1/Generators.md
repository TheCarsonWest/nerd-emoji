**Python [[Generators]]**

**Explanation:**

A Python [[Generator]] is a special type of iterable that lazily generates values one at a time. Unlike regular [[Lists]] or [[Tuples]] that store all elements in memory at once, [[Generators]] only produce values as they are requested. This makes them memory-efficient and suitable for processing large datasets.

**Parameters:**

* **yield:** The yield statement is used inside a [[Generator]] function to produce a value. Each yield statement pauses the function execution and returns the yielded value. When the [[Generator]] is resumed, it starts from the statement following yield.

* **next() method:** The next() method is used to retrieve the next value from the [[Generator]]. Calling next() advances the [[Generator]] to the next yield statement and returns the yielded value.

* **StopIteration exception:** When the [[Generator]] has produced all values and there are no more yield statements, the next() method raises a StopIteration exception.

**Code Examples:**

**Creating a [[Generator]] Function:**

```python
def fibonacci_[[Generator]]():
  a, b = 0, 1
  while True:
    yield a
    a, b = b, a + b
```

**Calling a [[Generator]] and Iterating:**

```python
for i in fibonacci_[[Generator]]():
  print(i)
  if i > 1000:
    break
```

**Other Python Concepts that Link Back to [[Generators]]:**

* [[Iterators]]: [[Generators]] are [[Iterators]], objects that can be iterated over to produce a sequence of values.
* [[Yield From]]: The yield from statement allows a [[Generator]] to delegate the iteration of another [[Generator]] or iterable.
* [[Coroutines]]: Coroutines are special functions that can be paused and resumed, similar to [[Generators]]. They use [[Generators]] behind the scenes for their implementation.
