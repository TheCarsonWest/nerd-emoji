**Python Generators**

**Explanation:**

A Python generator is a special type of iterable that lazily generates values one at a time. Unlike regular lists or tuples that store all elements in memory at once, generators only produce values as they are requested. This makes them memory-efficient and suitable for processing large datasets.

**Parameters:**

* **yield:** The yield statement is used inside a generator function to produce a value. Each yield statement pauses the function execution and returns the yielded value. When the generator is resumed, it starts from the statement following yield.

* **next() method:** The next() method is used to retrieve the next value from the generator. Calling next() advances the generator to the next yield statement and returns the yielded value.

* **StopIteration exception:** When the generator has produced all values and there are no more yield statements, the next() method raises a StopIteration exception.

**Code Examples:**

**Creating a Generator Function:**

```python
def fibonacci_generator():
  a, b = 0, 1
  while True:
    yield a
    a, b = b, a + b
```

**Calling a Generator and Iterating:**

```python
for i in fibonacci_generator():
  print(i)
  if i > 1000:
    break
```

**Other Python Concepts that Link Back to Generators:**

* **Iterators:** Generators are iterators, objects that can be iterated over to produce a sequence of values.
* **Yield From:** The yield from statement allows a generator to delegate the iteration of another generator or iterable.
* **Coroutines:** Coroutines are special functions that can be paused and resumed, similar to generators. They use generators behind the scenes for their implementation.
