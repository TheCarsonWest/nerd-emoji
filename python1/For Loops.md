# Python [[For Loops]]

## What are [[For Loops]]?
For loops are a control flow statement used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list, tuple, or string. They allow the execution of a code block for each element in the sequence.

## How to Use [[For Loops]]
The syntax of a for loop in Python is:

```python
for item in iterable:
 # code block to be executed for each item in the iterable
```

The `iterable` can be any sequence of items, such as a list, tuple, or string. The loop will execute the code block for each item in the iterable, assigning the value of the current item to the `item` variable.

## Code Examples
```python
# iterate over a list of names
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
for name in names:
 print(name)
```

```python
# iterate over a range of numbers
for number in range(10):
 print(number)
```

## Related Python Concepts

- [[Lists]]: For loops are commonly used to iterate over [[Lists]] of elements.
- [[Tuples]]: For loops can also be used to iterate over [[Tuples]] of elements.
- [[Strings]]: For loops can be used to iterate over the characters in a string.
- [[List Comprehension]]: For loops can be used to generate new [[Lists]] through [[List Comprehension]].
- [[Generators]]: For loops can be used to iterate over [[Generators]], which are objects that yield values one at a time.
