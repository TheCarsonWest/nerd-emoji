# [[Apostrophes]]

[[Apostrophes]] indicate either possession or contractions.

**1. Possession:**

*   **Singular nouns:** Add an apostrophe + *s* ('s).  Example:  the dog's bone.
*   **Plural nouns ending in *s*:** Add only an apostrophe after the *s*. Example: the dogs' bones.
*   **Plural nouns not ending in *s*:** Add an apostrophe + *s*. Example: the children's toys.
*   **Proper nouns ending in *s*:**  Generally add only an apostrophe. Example:  Charles's book or Charles' book (both are acceptable).
*   **Possessive pronouns:**  Do not use apostrophes with possessive pronouns (its, hers, his, ours, theirs, yours).  [[Possessive Pronouns]]


**2. Contractions:**

[[Apostrophes]] show where letters have been omitted in a contraction.

*   Examples:  can't (cannot), won't (will not), it's (it is),  they're (they are),  you're (you are),  I'm (I am),  he's (he is), she's (she is),  let's (let us).

**3. Special Cases:**

*   **Joint possession:** If two nouns possess something jointly, only the second noun needs the apostrophe. Example:  John and Mary's car.
*   **Individual possession:** If two nouns possess something individually, both nouns need the apostrophe. Example: John's and Mary's cars.


**4.  It's vs. Its:**

*   "It's" is a contraction of "it is" or "it has".
*   "Its" shows possession.  Example: The dog wagged its tail.  (No apostrophe!)

**5.  Who's vs. Whose:**

*   "Who's" is a contraction of "who is" or "who has".
*   "Whose" shows possession. Example: Whose book is this?


**6.  Equations (Illustrative):**

The number of apostrophes used depends on the context. There isn't a single mathematical equation to determine apostrophe usage.  However, we can represent the *process* symbolically:

* **Singular Possession:** $Noun + 's$
* **Plural Possession (ending in s):** $Noun's$
* **Plural Possession (not ending in s):** $Noun's$


This is a simplified representation.  The actual application requires understanding grammatical rules. [[Grammar Rules]]
