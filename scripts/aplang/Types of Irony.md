# [[Rhetorical Devices]]
# [[Types of Irony]]

There are three main types of irony:  verbal, situational, and dramatic.  Each has subtle differences.

* **Verbal Irony:** This involves a discrepancy between what is said and what is meant.  Often sarcastic.

    * Example: Saying "Oh, fantastic!" after failing an exam.

* **Situational Irony:** This occurs when the outcome of a situation is the opposite of what is expected.

    * Example: A fire station burning down.

* **Dramatic Irony:** This happens when the audience or reader knows something that the characters in a story do not. This creates suspense and/or humor.

    * Example: In a horror movie, the audience sees the killer hiding in the closet, but the character in the movie doesn't.

Further considerations:

* **Cosmic Irony:**  Sometimes considered a subtype of situational irony, this refers to the irony of fate or the universe seemingly working against a character or group. [[Cosmic Irony and Fate]]

* **Socratic Irony:** A form of verbal irony where someone pretends to be ignorant to draw out information from another. This often involves leading questions. [[Socratic Irony and its Uses]]

* **Ironic Tone:**  The overall feeling or attitude conveyed through the use of irony.  This can be humorous, tragic, or even satirical. [[Ironic Tone Analysis]]

* **Relationships between Irony Types:**  Sometimes, there's overlap between these types.  For example, a situation can be both dramatically and situationally ironic. [[Overlapping Irony Types]]

* **Mathematical equations related to irony (just kidding!):**  $ \text{Irony} = \frac{\text{Expectation}}{\text{Reality}} $  (This is a joke, not a real equation)

## $$ \text{Sarcasm} \subseteq \text{Verbal Irony} $$


This equation (also a joke) suggests that sarcasm is a subset of verbal irony.  Many consider sarcasm the most obvious form of verbal irony.
