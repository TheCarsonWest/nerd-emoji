# [[Rhetorical Devices]] in Argumentation]]

This note covers various rhetorical devices and their applications in crafting persuasive arguments.  

**I. Core Concepts:**

* **Ethos:** Appeal to credibility and authority.  Examples include citing expert opinions, showcasing personal experience, and establishing a trustworthy tone.  This relates directly to the audience's perception of the speaker/writer.
    * [[Building Ethos]]
* **Pathos:** Appeal to emotion.  This involves using vivid language, storytelling, and emotional appeals (e.g., fear, joy, anger) to connect with the audience on an emotional level.  The goal is to evoke a feeling that supports the argument.
    * [[Evoking Pathos Effectively]]
* **Logos:** Appeal to logic and reason.  This relies on presenting factual evidence, logical reasoning (deductive and inductive), and well-structured arguments to persuade the audience through rational means.

**II. Specific [[Rhetorical Devices]]:**

* **Anaphora:** Repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences.  Example:  *"I have a dream... I have a dream... I have a dream..."*  This creates emphasis and rhythm.
* **Epistrophe:** Repetition of a word or phrase at the end of successive clauses or sentences.  Example:  *"Government of the people, by the people, for the people."* This creates a sense of closure and emphasis.
* **Antithesis:** Juxtaposition of contrasting ideas or words in a balanced grammatical structure. Example:  *"Give me liberty, or give me death."*  This highlights the contrast and creates a powerful effect.
* **Metaphor:**  Implied comparison between two unrelated things. Example: *"The world is a stage."* This adds depth and imagery to the argument.
* **Simile:** Explicit comparison using "like" or "as." Example: *"He fought like a lion."*  Similar to metaphor but more direct.
* **Alliteration:** Repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words. Example:  *"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers."*  This adds emphasis and memorability.
* **Rhetorical Question:** A question asked to make a point, not to elicit an answer.  Example: *"Isn't it time we took action?"* This engages the audience and prompts reflection.

* The *context* of the argument.
* The *intended audience*.
* The *purpose* of the argument.
