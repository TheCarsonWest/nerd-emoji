# [[Evidence Evaluation & Citation]]
# [[Quantitative Evidence]]

**Definition:**  Quantitative evidence is data that can be measured and expressed numerically.  It's used to support claims and draw conclusions through statistical analysis.  This contrasts with qualitative evidence, which focuses on descriptions and interpretations.

**Types:**

* **Discrete Data:**  Data that can only take on specific, separate values (e.g., number of students in a class, number of cars in a parking lot).
* **Continuous Data:** Data that can take on any value within a range (e.g., height, weight, temperature).  Often requires rounding or measurement precision considerations.
* **Ratio Data:**  Has a true zero point and ratios are meaningful (e.g., weight, length). $x/y$ has meaning.
* **Interval Data:**  Has equal intervals between values but lacks a true zero point (e.g., temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit). $x-y$ has meaning, but $x/y$ doesn't.
* **Nominal Data:**  Categorical data with no inherent order (e.g., colors, gender).
* **Ordinal Data:**  Categorical data with an inherent order (e.g., rankings, educational levels).

**Methods of Collection:**

* Surveys [[Survey Design]]
* Experiments [[Experimental Design]]
* Observations [[Observational Studies]]
* Existing Datasets [[Data Sources]]

**Analysis Techniques:**

* **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing data using measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance.  ([[Descriptive Statistics]])
* **Inferential Statistics:** Making inferences about a population based on a sample of data.  This often involves hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. ([[Inferential Statistics]])
* **Regression Analysis:**  Examining relationships between variables. ([[Regression Analysis]])
* **Correlation Analysis:** Measuring the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. ([[Correlation Analysis]])


**Strengths:**

* Objective and unbiased (if collected properly).
* Allows for precise comparisons and measurements.
* Can reveal patterns and relationships that are not readily apparent through qualitative methods.
* Generalizable to larger populations (through inferential statistics).

**Weaknesses:**

* Can oversimplify complex phenomena.
* May not capture the full richness and context of a situation.
* Can be susceptible to bias if not carefully collected and analyzed.  ([[Bias in Quantitative Research]])
* Requires a large sample size for reliable results.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Validity:** Does the data measure what it is intended to measure?
* **Reliability:**  Are the results consistent and repeatable?
* **Sampling methods:** The chosen sampling method significantly impacts the generalizability of the findings. ([[Sampling Methods]])
* **Ethical considerations:**  Ensuring informed consent and data privacy. ([[Ethical Considerations in Research]])


**Example:**  A study measuring the effectiveness of a new drug by comparing the blood pressure of participants in a treatment group to a control group. The blood pressure measurements would be quantitative evidence.

## $$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} $$  (Formula for the sample mean)

## $$ s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}} $$ (Formula for the sample standard deviation)
