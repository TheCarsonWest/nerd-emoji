**I. Defining the Research Question:**

*   **Clarity and Focus:** The research question should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).  Avoid ambiguity. $Question \implies Answer$
*   **Background Research:**  Conduct preliminary research to understand the existing literature and identify knowledge gaps. [[Literature Review]]
*   **Hypothesis Formulation:**  Develop a testable hypothesis if appropriate.  $H_0: \text{Null Hypothesis}$ vs. $H_1: \text{Alternative Hypothesis}$


**II. Research Design:**

*   **Qualitative vs. Quantitative:**  Choose the appropriate methodology based on the research question. [[Qualitative Research Methods]], [[Quantitative Research Methods]]
*   **Sampling Methods:**  Select a representative sample to ensure generalizability. [[Sampling Techniques]]
*   **Data Collection Methods:** Determine how data will be gathered (e.g., surveys, interviews, experiments, observations). [[Data Collection Methods]]
*   **Ethical Considerations:**  Address potential ethical issues related to data privacy, informed consent, and potential harm to participants. [[Research Ethics]]

**III. Data Analysis:**

*   **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**  Check for errors, inconsistencies, and missing data.
*   **Statistical Analysis (Quantitative):**  Use appropriate statistical tests to analyze the data. [[Statistical Analysis Techniques]]  Examples include t-tests, ANOVA, regression analysis.  The choice depends on the type of data and research question.  $p < 0.05$ indicates statistical significance.
*   **Thematic Analysis (Qualitative):** Identify recurring themes and patterns in the data. [[Qualitative Data Analysis]]

**IV.  Reporting and Dissemination:**

*   **Writing the Research Report:**  Follow a standard format (e.g., IMRaD: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion). [[Research Report Writing]]
*   **Dissemination Strategies:** Consider publishing the research in academic journals, presenting at conferences, or sharing findings through other channels.


**V.  Iterative Process:**

Research is often an iterative process.  Findings from one study may lead to new research questions or refine existing hypotheses.  This is a cyclical process of refining the question, method and analysis and re-evaluating.
