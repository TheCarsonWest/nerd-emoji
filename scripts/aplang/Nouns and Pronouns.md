# [[Grammar and Mechanics]]
# [[Nouns and Pronouns]]

**Key Differences:**

Nouns are words that represent people, places, things, or ideas.  Pronouns are words that replace nouns to avoid repetition.

**Types of Nouns:**

* **Common Nouns:**  General names (e.g., cat, house, city)
* **Proper Nouns:** Specific names (e.g., Fluffy, White House, London).  Always capitalized.
* **Concrete Nouns:** Tangible things you can perceive with your senses (e.g., table, tree, music)
* **Abstract Nouns:** Intangible things, concepts, or ideas (e.g., love, justice, happiness)
* **Collective Nouns:**  Groups of individuals (e.g., team, flock, family)
* **Count Nouns:** Can be counted (e.g., two apples, three cars)
* **Non-count Nouns (Mass Nouns):** Cannot be counted (e.g., water, air, information).  Often use singular verb forms.


**Types of Pronouns:**

* **Personal Pronouns:** Refer to specific people or things (e.g., I, you, he, she, it, we, they, me, him, her, us, them).  [[Personal Pronoun Declension]]
* **Possessive Pronouns:** Show ownership (e.g., mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, theirs)
* **Reflexive Pronouns:** Refer back to the subject of the sentence (e.g., myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves)
* **Intensive Pronouns:** Emphasize the noun or pronoun they refer to (same forms as reflexive pronouns, but function differently).  [[Reflexive vs. Intensive Pronouns]]
* **Demonstrative Pronouns:** Point to specific things (e.g., this, that, these, those)
* **Interrogative Pronouns:** Used to ask questions (e.g., who, whom, whose, which, what)
* **Relative Pronouns:** Introduce relative clauses (e.g., who, whom, whose, which, that)
* **Indefinite Pronouns:** Refer to nonspecific people or things (e.g., someone, anyone, everyone, no one, somebody, anybody, everybody, nobody, something, anything, everything, nothing)


**Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement:**

A pronoun must agree in number (singular or plural) and gender with its antecedent (the noun it replaces).

Example:  The *dog* wagged *its* tail.  (Singular antecedent, singular pronoun)

Incorrect: The *dogs* wagged *its* tail. (Plural antecedent, singular pronoun)  Should be: The *dogs* wagged *their* tail.


**Case:**

Pronouns change form depending on their grammatical function in a sentence (subjective, objective, possessive).  [[Pronoun Case]]


**Number:**

The number of a pronoun (singular or plural) must match the number of its antecedent.


**Gender:**

The gender of a pronoun (masculine, feminine, neuter) should generally match the gender of its antecedent, though the use of gender-neutral pronouns is increasingly common.
