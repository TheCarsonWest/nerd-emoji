# [[Grammar and Mechanics]]
# [[Verb Tense Consistency]]

Maintaining consistent verb tense throughout a piece of writing is crucial for clarity and readability.  Inconsistent tenses can confuse the reader and make the text seem disjointed.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Narrative Tense:**  Choose a tense (past, present, or future) and stick to it unless there's a clear reason to shift.  Commonly, narratives use past tense ($V_{past}$), but present tense ($V_{present}$) can be used for effect (e.g., in literary analysis or when describing ongoing actions).  Future tense ($V_{future}$) is less common in narrative but can be used for foreshadowing or predictions.

* **Shifting Tense:** While generally avoided, justifiable shifts can occur:
    * **To indicate a shift in time:**  "He walked to the store, *but then he realized* he'd forgotten his wallet." (Past tense shifts to past perfect to show prior action.)
    * **To represent different levels of reality:** "The story *takes place* in a futuristic city, but the main character *feels* trapped in the past." (Present tense describing the setting, past tense for character's emotion.)
    * **To incorporate direct quotes:** "She *said*, 'I *am* going to the party.'" (Past tense reporting verb, present tense direct quote.)

* **Common Mistakes:**
    * **Unnecessary shifts:**  Switching between past and present tense without a logical reason.
    * **Mixing tenses within a single sentence:**  "He walks to the store and bought milk." (Should be past tense throughout or present tense throughout)
    * **Incorrect use of perfect tenses:**  Misusing present perfect ($V_{present \ perfect}$), past perfect ($V_{past \ perfect}$), or future perfect ($V_{future \ perfect}$)


**Examples:**

* **Inconsistent:**  "He walked to the store.  He buys milk."
* **Consistent (Past Tense):** "He walked to the store. He bought milk."
* **Consistent (Present Tense):** "He walks to the store. He buys milk."
