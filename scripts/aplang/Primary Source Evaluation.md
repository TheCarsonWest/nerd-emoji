**Definition:**  Assessing the credibility, reliability, and authenticity of a primary source.  This involves critically examining the source's origin, author, context, and content to determine its value and limitations.

**Key Questions to Ask:**

* **Authorship:**
    * Who created the source?
    * What is known about the author's background, biases, and potential motives?
    * Is the author an eyewitness or participant?  If not, how did they obtain their information?
* **Context:**
    * When and where was the source created?
    * What historical events or circumstances influenced its creation?
    * What was the intended audience?
* **Content:**
    * What claims does the source make?
    * What evidence is presented to support those claims?
    * Are there any inconsistencies or contradictions within the source or with other sources?
    * What is the source's tone and style?  Is it objective or subjective?
* **Authenticity:**
    * Is the source genuine?  Has it been altered or forged?
    * What evidence supports its authenticity?


**Types of Bias to Consider:**

* **Author Bias:**  The author's personal beliefs, experiences, and perspectives can influence their representation of events.
* **Confirmation Bias:** The tendency to favor information that confirms pre-existing beliefs.
* **Omission Bias:** The intentional or unintentional exclusion of relevant information.
* **Selection Bias:**  The biased selection of data or evidence to support a particular viewpoint.


**Evaluating Different Source Types:**

* [[Evaluating Letters and Diaries]]:  Focus on the author's emotional state, personal experiences, and potential biases.
* [[Evaluating Government Documents]]: Consider the political context and potential for propaganda.
* [[Evaluating Photographs]]:  Analyze composition, context, and potential manipulation.
* [[Evaluating Oral Histories]]: Account for memory biases and potential changes in narrative over time.


**Methods for Corroboration:**

Compare the source with other primary sources and secondary sources to identify corroborating evidence and inconsistencies.  Triangulation of sources is key.


**Assessing Reliability:**

Reliability refers to the consistency and accuracy of the information presented.  Consider the source's internal consistency and its consistency with other sources.


**Formula for Evaluating Credibility (Conceptual):**

$Credibility = \frac{Authenticity \times Reliability}{Bias}$

## $$Credibility = \frac{A \times R}{B}$$

Where:

* $A$ = Authenticity
* $R$ = Reliability
* $B$ = Bias

This is a framework; the specific questions and methods will vary depending on the type of primary source and the research question.
