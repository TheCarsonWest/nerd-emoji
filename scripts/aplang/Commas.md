# [[Commas]]

Notes on comma usage.

**Basic Rules:**

* **Joining independent clauses:** Use a comma before a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet) joining two independent clauses.  Example:  The sun was shining, and the birds were singing.

* **Listing items:** Use commas to separate items in a series.  Example: I bought apples, bananas, and oranges.  (Note: the Oxford comma before the "and" is optional but often preferred for clarity).

* **Introductory elements:** Use a comma after introductory words, phrases, or clauses.  Example:  After a long day, I went to bed.  However, I couldn't sleep.

* **Nonrestrictive phrases and clauses:** Use commas to set off nonrestrictive elements (information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence). Example: My car, which is a bright red convertible, is very expensive.  (If you removed "which is a bright red convertible," the sentence would still make sense.)

* **Restrictive phrases and clauses:** Do *not* use commas to set off restrictive elements (information that is essential to the meaning of the sentence). Example:  The car that I bought is red. (Removing "that I bought" would change the meaning).

* **Dates and addresses:**  Use commas in dates and addresses:  Example:  November 14, 2024, was a Monday. I live at 123 Main Street, Anytown, CA 91234.


**Advanced Rules & Exceptions:**

* **Comma Splices:**  Avoid comma splices – joining two independent clauses with only a comma.  This is a grammatical error. [[Comma Splice Examples]]

* **Serial [[Commas]] (Oxford Comma):**  The debate over the Oxford comma. [[Oxford Comma Debate]]

* **[[Commas]] with coordinating adjectives:** Use commas between coordinating adjectives (adjectives that equally modify the noun). Example:  The tall, dark stranger entered the room.  (But *not* "the tall dark brown horse"—the adjectives are not equally modifying the noun)

* **[[Commas]] and quotations:** Comma placement with direct quotations. [[Commas]] and Quotations]]

* **[[Commas]] in complex sentences:**  [[Commas]] with multiple clauses and phrases. [[Complex Sentence [[Commas]]


**Equations (Illustrative, not directly related to commas):**

The equation for the area of a circle is:  $A = \pi r^2$

The quadratic formula is:
## $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
