# [[Evidence Evaluation & Citation]]
# [[Qualitative Evidence]]

**Definition:** Qualitative evidence is information that is descriptive and focuses on the qualities of something rather than its quantity.  It's often rich in detail and provides context and understanding, but may be subjective and harder to analyze statistically.

**Types of [[Qualitative Evidence]]:**

* **Interviews:**  Structured, semi-structured, or unstructured conversations with individuals. [[Interview Techniques]]
* **Focus Groups:** Guided discussions with small groups of people. [[Focus Group Moderation]]
* **Observations:**  Systematic watching and recording of behaviors or events. [[Observation Methods]]
* **Case Studies:** In-depth investigations of a single individual, group, or event. [[Case Study Analysis]]
* **Documents and Texts:**  Analysis of existing written materials, such as diaries, letters, or reports. [[Document Analysis]]
* **Visual Data:** Photographs, videos, artwork, etc. [[Visual Data Analysis]]


**Strengths:**

* Rich detail and context
* Provides in-depth understanding of perspectives and experiences
* Can uncover unexpected findings
* Useful for exploratory research
* Flexible and adaptable

**Weaknesses:**

* Subjectivity and potential for bias
* Difficult to generalize findings to a larger population
* Time-consuming to collect and analyze
* Can be difficult to replicate
* Analysis can be challenging and interpretive


**Data Analysis Techniques:**

* **Thematic Analysis:** Identifying recurring themes and patterns in the data. [[Thematic Analysis]]
* **Grounded Theory:** Developing a theory based on the data collected. [[Grounded Theory]]
* **Narrative Analysis:**  Focusing on the stories and experiences of individuals. [[Narrative Analysis]]
* **Content Analysis:**  Systematic coding and categorization of text or visual data. [[Content Analysis]]


**Relationship to [[Quantitative Evidence]]:**

Qualitative and quantitative evidence can be used together in **mixed methods research** to provide a more complete understanding of a phenomenon.  $Qualitative \text{ } + \text{ } Quantitative = \text{ } Holistic \text{ } Understanding$


**Example Research Questions:**

* What are the experiences of patients with chronic illness?
* How do teachers perceive the impact of new curriculum?
* What are the social factors that contribute to homelessness?
