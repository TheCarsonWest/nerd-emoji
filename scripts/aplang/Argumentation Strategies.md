These notes outline common argumentation strategies.  I'll link to more detailed explanations where appropriate.

**I. Core Strategies:**

* **Claim-Reason-Evidence (CRE):**  This is the foundational structure.
    * **Claim:** The statement you're arguing for.  $Claim$
    * **Reason:** Why the claim is true.  $Reason \implies Claim$
    * **Evidence:** Data supporting the reason.  This could be statistics, examples, expert opinions, etc. $Evidence \implies Reason$
    * Example:  Claim: We should invest in renewable energy. Reason: It reduces carbon emissions. Evidence: Studies show a significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions with increased renewable energy use.

* **[[Toulmin Model]]:**  A more nuanced approach to CRE, adding:
    * **Warrant:** The underlying assumption connecting the reason and the evidence.  $Warrant: Reason \implies Evidence$
    * **Backing:** Support for the warrant.
    * **Qualifier:** Limits the claim (e.g., "generally," "often," "in most cases").
    * **Rebuttal:** Acknowledges and addresses potential counterarguments. [[Toulmin Model]] Deep Dive]]

* **Deductive Reasoning:** Moving from general principles to specific conclusions.
    * Example: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.  This follows the form:  $P \implies Q; P; \therefore Q$

* **Inductive Reasoning:** Moving from specific observations to general conclusions.
    * Example: Every swan I've ever seen is white. Therefore, all swans are white. (Note: This is a flawed example, as black swans exist).

**II. Advanced Strategies:**

* **Analogical Reasoning:** Comparing similar situations to draw conclusions.  The strength depends on the relevance of the analogy. [[Analogical Reasoning and its Limits]]
* **Causal Reasoning:** Establishing cause-and-effect relationships.  This often requires ruling out alternative explanations. [[Causal Inference and Counterfactuals]]
* **Abductive Reasoning:** Inferring the best explanation for a given observation. [[Abductive Reasoning and Hypothesis Formation]]


**III. Fallacies to Avoid:**  These are common errors in reasoning. [[Common Argumentative Fallacies]]

**IV.  Rhetorical Strategies:** These are persuasive techniques, but they don't necessarily make an argument *logically* sound. [[Rhetorical Devices]] and Persuasion]]


**V.  Organizing Arguments:**

* Chronological order
* Spatial order
* Topical order
* Problem-solution order
* Comparative order


This is a working document; I will expand on these points later.
