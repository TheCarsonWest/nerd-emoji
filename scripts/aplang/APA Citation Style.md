# [[Evidence Evaluation & Citation]]
# [[APA Citation Style]]

**Main Components:**

* **In-text citations:**  These briefly identify the source within the text.  They typically include the author's last name and year of publication.  For example: (Smith, 2023).  Multiple authors are handled differently depending on the number:  (Smith & Jones, 2023) for two, (Smith et al., 2023) for three or more.

* **Reference list:** This is a complete alphabetical list of all sources cited in the paper.  Each entry follows a specific format depending on the source type (book, journal article, website, etc.).

**Common Source Types & Formats:**

* **Journal Article:**  Author, A. A. (Year). Title of article. *Title of Periodical*, *volume*(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xx.xxx/yyyy  
    *Example:*  Smith, J. (2024). The impact of social media. *Journal of Psychology*, *12*(3), 15-28. https://doi.org/10.1234/example

* **Book:** Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work*. Publisher.
    *Example:*  Jones, B. (2023). *Introduction to Sociology*. Pearson.

* **Website:**  Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). *Title of page*. Site name. URL

* **Edited Book Chapter:** Author, A. A. (Year). Title of chapter. In A. Editor & B. Editor (Eds.), *Title of book* (pp. pages). Publisher.


**Specific Considerations:**

* **Direct Quotes:**  Direct quotations require page numbers in the in-text citation: (Smith, 2023, p. 10).  Longer quotes (generally 40 words or more) are block quoted and formatted differently.

* **Multiple Citations:** Separate multiple citations with semicolons: (Smith, 2023; Jones, 2024).

* **Multiple Works by the Same Author:** Use chronological order of publication, adding "a", "b", "c", etc after the year. (Smith, 2020a; Smith, 2020b).


**Equations:**

The following is an example of calculating the mean:

$Mean = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$

The variance can be calculated using the following equation:

## $$Variance = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$
