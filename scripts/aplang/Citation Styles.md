# [[Citation Styles]]

This note covers different citation styles and their applications.

**Key Styles:**

* **MLA (Modern Language Association):** Primarily used in the humanities.  Emphasizes author-page citations within the text ($e.g.,$ (Smith 123)).  A "Works Cited" page lists full bibliographic information.

* **APA (American Psychological Association):** Commonly used in social sciences.  Author-date citations are used in-text ($e.g.,$ (Smith, 2023)).  A "References" page provides complete bibliographic details.  [[APA Style Guide]]

* **Chicago/Turabian:** Offers both a notes-bibliography and author-date system.  The notes-bibliography style uses footnotes or endnotes for citations, with a bibliography listing all sources. The author-date system is similar to APA. [[Chicago Manual of Style]]

* **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers):** Used frequently in engineering and computer science.  Numerical citations are used in-text, referencing a numbered list of sources at the end of the document. [[IEEE Citation Guide]]


**Choosing a Style:**

The appropriate citation style depends largely on the discipline and the publication guidelines.  Always check the specific requirements of the journal, conference, or institution.

**General Principles:**

* **Consistency:**  Maintain a consistent style throughout the entire document.
* **Accuracy:**  Ensure all citation information is accurate and complete.
* **Completeness:** Include all necessary information for each source.


**Software and Tools:**

Several software tools and citation managers can assist in creating citations and bibliographies. Examples include:

* Zotero
* Mendeley
* EndNote


**Common Issues:**

* **Plagiarism:** Improper citation constitutes plagiarism.  Always cite your sources properly. [[Plagiarism and Academic Integrity]]
* **In-text vs. Bibliography:**  Make sure in-text citations correctly correspond to entries in the bibliography/references/works cited.
* **Formatting:** Pay close attention to formatting details, such as capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, as these vary across citation styles.


**Equations:**

The number of citations needed in a document can be modeled (in a simplified way) by:

$$ C = \alpha L + \beta $$

where:

* $C$ is the number of citations.
* $L$ is the length of the document.
* $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters that depend on the field and writing style.


This is a very basic model; the actual relationship is much more complex.  For a more accurate representation, a more sophisticated model would need to be developed, taking into account various factors such as the complexity of the subject matter, the number of sources used, and the citation style employed.
