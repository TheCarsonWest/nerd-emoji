# [[[[Rhetorical Devices]] in Argumentation]]
# [[Logical Fallacies to Avoid]]

These notes detail common logical fallacies to avoid in arguments and reasoning.  Referencing these will improve the clarity and persuasiveness of my own arguments and help me identify fallacies in others' arguments.

**I. Fallacies of Relevance:** These fallacies appeal to something other than the evidence at hand.

* **Ad Hominem:** Attacking the person making the argument instead of the argument itself.  Example: "You can't believe anything he says; he's a liar!"  [[Fallacies of Relevance]]

* **Appeal to Authority:** Claiming something is true simply because an authority figure said it, without further evidence. Example: "My doctor says climate change is a hoax, so it must be true." [[Appeal to Authority Fallacy]]

* **Appeal to Emotion:** Manipulating emotions (fear, pity, anger) instead of providing logical reasons. Example: "If we don't pass this bill, our children will starve!"  [[Appeal to Emotion Fallacy]]

* **Appeal to Popularity (Bandwagon Fallacy):**  Arguing that something is true because many people believe it. Example: "Everyone is buying this phone, so it must be good." [[Appeal to Popularity Fallacy]]

* **Red Herring:** Introducing an irrelevant topic to distract from the main argument. Example: "You're criticizing my economic policy, but what about the rising crime rate?" [[Red Herring Fallacy]]

* **Straw Man:** Misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack. Example: "He wants to ban all cars! That's ridiculous." (When the actual proposal was to increase taxes on gas-guzzling vehicles). [[Straw Man Fallacy]]


**II. Fallacies of Ambiguity:** These fallacies arise from the imprecise use of language.

* **Equivocation:** Using the same word in different senses within an argument. Example: "The sign said 'fine for parking here', and since it was fine, I parked there." [[Equivocation Fallacy]]

* **Amphiboly:**  A fallacy of grammatical structure that leads to multiple interpretations. Example: "I saw the man with binoculars." (Was the man using binoculars or did *I* use them?) [[Amphiboly Fallacy]]


**III. Fallacies of Presumption:** These fallacies make unwarranted assumptions.

* **False Dilemma (Either/Or Fallacy):** Presenting only two options when more exist. Example: "You're either with us or against us." [[False Dilemma Fallacy]]

* **Hasty Generalization:** Drawing a conclusion based on insufficient evidence. Example: "I met two rude people from that city, so everyone from there must be rude." [[Hasty Generalization Fallacy]]

* **Begging the Question (Circular Reasoning):** The conclusion is assumed in the premise. Example: "God exists because the Bible says so, and the Bible is the word of God." [[Begging the Question Fallacy]]

* **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (False Cause):** Assuming that because one event followed another, the first event caused the second. Example: "I wore my lucky socks, and we won the game; therefore, my socks caused us to win." [[Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc Fallacy]]

* **Slippery Slope:** Arguing that a small first step will inevitably lead to a series of negative consequences. Example: "If we legalize marijuana, then everyone will become addicted to heroin." [[Slippery Slope Fallacy]]


**IV.  Other Fallacies:**

* **Texas Sharpshooter:** Cherry-picking data to support a pre-conceived conclusion.  [[Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy]]

* **Correlation vs. Causation:** Mistaking correlation for causation. Just because two things happen together doesn't mean one caused the other. [[Correlation vs. Causation Fallacy]]


This is a preliminary list;  I will expand on these as needed.  Additional research into specific fallacies will be documented in separate notes.
