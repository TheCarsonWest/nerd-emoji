# [[Evidence Evaluation & Citation]]

**I. Evaluating Evidence:**

* **Credibility:**  Consider the source's expertise, reputation, potential biases, and publication process.  Is it a peer-reviewed journal? A reputable news source? A government report? Or a blog post?  [[Source Credibility]]

* **Relevance:** Does the evidence directly support the claim being made?  Is it applicable to the context?  [[Relevance & Applicability]]

* **Accuracy:** Is the information factual and free from errors? Are the data and statistics correctly presented and interpreted? Are there any conflicting sources that need to be considered? [[Data Accuracy & Verification]]

* **Completeness:** Does the evidence provide a comprehensive picture of the issue? Are there any missing pieces of the puzzle? Are there any counterarguments that should be considered? [[Completeness and Counterarguments]]

* **Sufficiency:** Is there enough evidence to support the claim?  $n \ge 30$ for statistical significance (in many cases). [[Statistical Significance]]


* **Timeliness:** Is the evidence current and up-to-date?  Outdated information may not be relevant. [[Timeliness of Evidence]]


**II. [[Citation Styles]]:**

Different fields and publications require different citation styles.  Consistency is key.

* **MLA:** Commonly used in humanities.  Example: (Author's Last Name Page Number). [[MLA Citation Style]]
* **APA:** Commonly used in social sciences.  Example: (Author's Last Name, Year, Page Number). [[APA Citation Style]]
* **Chicago:**  Multiple styles within Chicago (Notes & Bibliography, Author-Date).  [[Chicago Citation Style]]

Understanding common fallacies is crucial for critically evaluating evidence. 
* **Ad hominem:** Attacking the person making the argument instead of the argument itself.
* **Appeal to authority:**  Accepting an argument solely because an authority figure claims it to be true.
* **Bandwagon fallacy:**  Assuming something is true because it is popular.
* **Straw man fallacy:**  Misrepresenting an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack.  [[Logical Fallacies]]


**V.  Types of Evidence:**

* **Quantitative Data:** Numerical data (e.g., statistics, measurements). [[Quantitative Evidence]]
* **Qualitative Data:** Non-numerical data (e.g., interviews, observations). [[Qualitative Evidence]]
* **Anecdotal Evidence:** Personal stories or observations.  Generally considered weak evidence on its own.
