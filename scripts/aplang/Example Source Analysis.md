# [[Source Analysis Techniques]]
# [[Example Source Analysis]]

**Goal:** Critically evaluate the source "Example Source" (needs to be specified!) to determine its credibility, bias, and usefulness for research.

**I. Source Identification:**

* **Author:**  $Author = \text{Unknown?}$  Needs to be identified and their credentials investigated. [[Author Background Check]]
* **Publication:**  $Publication = \text{Unknown?}$  What is the publication's reputation? [[Publication Credibility]]
* **Date of Publication:** $Date = \text{Unknown?}$  How recent is the information?  Is it still relevant?
* **Type of Source:**  Is it a primary source, secondary source, or tertiary source?  $SourceType = \text{Unknown?}$ [[Source Types]]

**II. Content Analysis:**

* **Claim(s):** What are the main arguments or claims being made?  List them clearly.
* **Evidence:** What evidence is presented to support the claims? Is the evidence sufficient and credible? [[Evidence Evaluation]]
* **Bias:** Does the source exhibit any bias?  Is it overt or subtle?  Identify potential sources of bias (e.g., political affiliation, funding, author's background).  [[Identifying Bias]]
* **Accuracy:** Is the information presented accurate and factual?  Can it be verified through other sources? [[Fact-Checking Methods]]
* **Objectivity:** How objective is the source's presentation of information? Does it present multiple perspectives?

**III. Contextualization:**

* **Audience:** Who is the intended audience for this source? How might this influence the source's content and style?
* **Purpose:** What is the purpose of the source? Is it to inform, persuade, entertain, etc.?


**IV. Evaluation:**

* **Credibility:** Overall assessment of the source's credibility based on the above analysis.
* **Usefulness:**  How useful is this source for my research?  What are its strengths and weaknesses?

**V. References:**

* List all sources consulted during the analysis.


**VI. Notes:**

* [[Evaluating Numerical Data]] - If the source includes numerical data, this will need specific analysis.
* [[Evaluating Visual Data]] - If the source includes charts, graphs, or images, their interpretation and credibility require separate attention.
