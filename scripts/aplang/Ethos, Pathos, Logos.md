# [[Rhetorical Devices]]
# [[Ethos, Pathos, Logos]] Notes

These are my notes on the three modes of persuasion: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos.

**Ethos:**  Appeal to credibility or character.  This involves establishing your authority and trustworthiness as a speaker or writer.

*   **Key elements:** Expertise, trustworthiness, goodwill, shared values.
*   **How to achieve it:**  Use credible sources, cite evidence, demonstrate understanding of the audience's concerns, present yourself as knowledgeable and unbiased, use appropriate tone and style.
*   **Example:** "As a doctor with 20 years of experience, I can confidently say..."

**Pathos:** Appeal to emotion. This involves connecting with the audience's feelings to persuade them.

*   **Key elements:** Empathy, emotional connection, shared values.
*   **How to achieve it:** Use vivid language, storytelling, imagery, personal anecdotes, and emotionally charged words.  [[Pathos Examples]]
*   **Example:**  A story about a child affected by a particular issue to evoke sympathy.  The use of emotionally charged words like “heartbreaking” or “inspiring.”

**Logos:** Appeal to logic and reason. This involves using evidence and logical arguments to persuade the audience.

*   **Key elements:**  Reasoning, evidence, logical structure, data.
*   **How to achieve it:** Use facts, statistics, examples, analogies, and logical reasoning to support your claims.  Construct well-organized arguments with clear premises and conclusions. Avoid logical fallacies.  ([[Logical Fallacies]])
*   **Example:**  "Studies show that..."  Presenting a step-by-step explanation of a process with supporting data. $P \implies Q$


**Relationship between Ethos, Pathos, and Logos:**

These three appeals are not mutually exclusive; they often work together to create a persuasive message. A strong argument typically uses a combination of all three.  The balance of these appeals depends on the audience, the topic, and the purpose of the communication.  For instance, a scientific paper might rely heavily on logos, while a political speech might employ a greater balance of pathos and ethos.  There is also the idea of an effective persuasive appeal relying on the *perceived* ethos, pathos, and logos of the presenter.  The perception is sometimes more influential than the actuality.
