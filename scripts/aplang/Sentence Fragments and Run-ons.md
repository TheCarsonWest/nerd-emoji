These notes cover identifying and correcting sentence fragments and run-on sentences.

**I. Sentence Fragments:**

A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence; it lacks a subject, a verb, or both, or it doesn't express a complete thought.

* **Types of Fragments:**
    * **Dependent Clause Fragments:** These begin with subordinating conjunctions (e.g., *because, although, since, if, while*) or relative pronouns (e.g., *who, whom, which, that*).  Example: *Because it was raining.*  ([[Dependent Clauses]])
    * **Phrase Fragments:** These are groups of words that lack a subject and a verb. Example: *Running down the street.*
    * **Missing Subject Fragments:** The verb is present, but the subject is missing. Example: *Ate all the cookies.*
    * **Missing Verb Fragments:** The subject is present, but the verb is missing. Example: *The dog in the yard.*


* **Correcting Fragments:**  Add the missing elements to create a complete sentence.  For example, *Because it was raining, the game was cancelled.* or *The dog in the yard barked loudly.*

**II. Run-on Sentences:**

A run-on sentence (also called a fused sentence or a comma splice) occurs when two or more independent clauses are joined incorrectly.

* **Types of Run-ons:**
    * **Comma Splice:** Two independent clauses joined only by a comma. Example: *The cat sat on the mat, it looked very comfortable.*
    * **Fused Sentence:** Two independent clauses joined with no punctuation or conjunction. Example: *The cat sat on the mat it looked very comfortable.*


* **Correcting Run-ons:**
    * **Add a coordinating conjunction:**  Use words like *and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet* to join the independent clauses.  Example: *The cat sat on the mat, and it looked very comfortable.*
    * **Use a semicolon:** A semicolon can join two closely related independent clauses. Example: *The cat sat on the mat; it looked very comfortable.*
    * **Use a colon:**  A colon can be used if the second clause explains or illustrates the first. Example: *The cat had a comfortable spot: the mat.*
    * **Separate into two sentences:** The simplest solution is often to make two separate sentences. Example: *The cat sat on the mat. It looked very comfortable.*
    * **Use a conjunctive adverb:** Use words like *however, therefore, moreover, consequently, furthermore* with a semicolon before and a comma after.  Example: *The cat sat on the mat; however, it soon jumped down.*

**V. Key Equations (Illustrative -  not directly related to grammar, but helpful in related fields like NLP):**

* Probability of a sentence being a fragment: $P(Fragment) = \frac{Number\ of\ fragments}{Total\ number\ of\ sentences}$ (This is a simplified example)
*  N-gram models can be used in sentence analysis to predict the likelihood of certain sentence structures. [[N-gram Models]]
