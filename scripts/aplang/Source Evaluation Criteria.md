# [[Source Evaluation Criteria]]

These notes outline criteria for evaluating information sources.  The goal is to determine the credibility, reliability, and authority of a source before using it in research or decision-making.

**I. Authority:**

* **Author Expertise:**  What are the author's credentials?  $expertise = f(education, experience, publications)$  Are they recognized experts in the field? [[Author Expertise Evaluation]]
* **Publisher Reputation:** Is the source published by a reputable organization or journal?  Consider the publisher's history, mission, and peer-review processes. [[Publisher Reputation]]
* **Source Type:** What type of source is it (e.g., scholarly article, website, book, government document)? Different source types have different levels of credibility. [[Source Type Credibility]]


**II. Accuracy:**

* **Factual Accuracy:**  Is the information presented accurate and verifiable?  Are there citations or references supporting the claims? [[Fact Verification Methods]]
* **Objectivity:** Is the information presented objectively, or does it show bias or a particular point of view?  Look for evidence of bias, such as loaded language or selective use of evidence. [[Identifying Bias in Sources]]
* **Currency:** How recent is the information?  Is it up-to-date and relevant to the current context?  For some topics, older information may still be relevant, while for others, it may be outdated. [[Evaluating Source Currency]]


**III. Purpose:**

* **Intended Audience:** Who is the intended audience of the source?  Does this affect the information presented?
* **Purpose of Creation:** What was the author's purpose in creating this source? To inform, persuade, entertain, or something else?  Understanding the purpose can help to evaluate the credibility of the information. [[Authorial Intent]]


**IV. Coverage:**

* **Depth and Breadth:** Does the source provide sufficient depth and breadth of coverage on the topic?  Is the information comprehensive, or does it only cover a narrow aspect?
* **Perspective:** Does the source present a balanced perspective, or does it focus on a particular viewpoint?

**V.  Overall Assessment:**

After considering the above criteria, make an overall judgment about the source's credibility and reliability.  Consider using a rating system (e.g., high, medium, low) to summarize your assessment.  Document your reasoning.

**Example Equation:**  A simple model for source credibility could be:

$$Credibility = w_1 \times Authority + w_2 \times Accuracy + w_3 \times Purpose$$

where $w_1, w_2, w_3$ are weights assigned to each factor based on their relative importance.  The specific weights will depend on the context and the type of source being evaluated.
