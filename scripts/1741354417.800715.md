**The Hundred Years War: A Defining Conflict**

*clears throat*

The Hundred Years War. The words conjure images of chivalry and pageantry: knights in gleaming armor, jousting at tournaments; the legendary English archer decimating the ranks of French nobility; the iconic battles of Crécy, Poitiers, and Agincourt. Yet, behind the romanticized vision lies a stark reality – the brutal face of the Middle Ages. It was a period marked by senseless warfare, devastating destruction, and the tragic loss of countless lives in the muddy fields of France, all fueled by the greed and ambition of kings.

The Hundred Years War encompasses all these elements. It's a story of courage, the clash of nations, and the timeless struggle for supremacy. But it's also something more profound: the story of a war that helped define England. It shaped her sense of national identity, molded her language, and cemented her role on the world stage. The Hundred Years War, in essence, helped forge a nation.

**A Throne Usurped, a King Determined**

The year is 1328. A young man sits on the throne of England, Edward III. But he is powerless. His mother's lover, Roger Mortimer, has seized control. However, Edward possesses the heart of a warrior and the mind of a leader. In 1330, at the tender age of 17, he gathers his loyal friends and, under the cloak of pale moonlight, infiltrates Mortimer's castle. They cut down the guards and seize Mortimer himself. The interloper is dragged through the jeering crowds of London to the infamous Tyburn tree, where countless traitors would meet their end. There, he is hanged until dead.

From that moment forward, Edward is determined to make England and his royal court a shining beacon of culture for all of Christendom. His court becomes a vibrant spectacle of color, music, tournaments, and poetry. He surrounds himself with the wealthiest nobles and models his court on the mythical Camelot of King Arthur, embracing the cult of chivalry. But inherent to this cult is the expectation that the King will lead his nobles to war, seeking wealth and glory.

While the nobility occasionally chafed under the King's authority, they remained, for the most part, his natural allies. They held their lands from him and collaborated in governing the kingdom and its people. And so, with his most powerful nobles at his side, Edward embarked on what he loved most and for what he was born: he led his nobility to war and crushed the Scots in battle.

**France at the Gates**

But in 1337, Edward's world faced a new threat: the French were at the gates. Well, not literally at the gates of England. The situation was far more complex, rooted in centuries of medieval inheritance law and international politics. To unravel this tangled web, we need to delve into the intricate history of the French and English royal dynasties, who had been fighting over land in France for centuries.

In the blue corner, we have the French royal dynasty: the Valois. And in the red corner, the English royal dynasty: the Plantagenets. King Philip VI of France, representing the Valois, was determined to wrest the last of Edward's French lands away from him. Medieval kingdoms did not adhere to modern borders or rules; they were the property of a King and his nobles.

English claims in France stretched back to 1066, when William the Bastard, a French noble, decided he deserved more than his lands in Normandy. He capitalized on a distant claim to the English throne, crossed the English Channel, conquered the English, and became known to history as William the Conqueror. The old Anglo-Saxon landowners were swept aside, and England became the property of French-speaking lords. French became the language of the nobility, of literature, and of the King's Court, while English remained the language of peasants and serfs.

Fast forward a century, and in 1155, Henry of Anjou became King Henry II of England. More French land was added to the English holdings in Normandy that came from old Willy the Conq. Plus, Henry married Eleanor of Aquitaine, the richest heiress in Europe. She brought even more French land to the English crown. Henry and his successors, the Plantagenet royal family, now controlled almost half of modern France. They spoke French, loved France, and considered themselves French.

**Homage and Lip Service**

But there was a catch. Most of these lands were, in theory, still owned by the Kings of France. Like all medieval vassals, anyone with lands in France was supposed to kneel and pay homage to the Valois kings. In practice, powerful figures like William the Conqueror and Henry II were too powerful to be forced to obey the Valois. They merely paid lip service to the French King's theoretical rights and carried on as they pleased.

Over the centuries, however, the Valois used their rights to reclaim much of that land while weaker Plantagenets sat on the English throne. By the time Edward III was born, only a single province remained in English hands: Gascony. King Philip VI of France was determined to take that last province away from the Plantagenets.

Philip had no doubt that he could achieve this goal. France was, after all, the most powerful and glorious country in Christendom. It was a leading center of culture and learning. Philip considered only the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor as his equals. England, in contrast, was just a small, damp, and slightly grubby country somewhere in the North Sea. The French nobility considered themselves the shining example of chivalry, a status they did not grant to the English nobility.

Philip made trouble for Edward, forming an alliance with the Scots against the English. Then, in 1337, at his court, he formally confiscated Gascony. Edward attempted to negotiate, but Philip refused. Edward, in turn, vowed to defend his rights with the edge of his sword.

**The Wool Trade and the Flemish Alliance**

The confiscation of Gascony was not only an insult to Edward but also a threat to English merchants. England relied on two major sources of wealth: the wine trade with Gascony and the wool trade with the county of Flanders (modern-day Belgium). Both the Gascon merchants and the English dreaded the loss of the wine trade.

Even more important was the wool trade. The textile industry was by far the largest industry in medieval Europe, dwarfing all others except agriculture. This industry was dominated by the densely populated towns of northern Italy and Flanders. English wool, considered the best in Europe for its fineness and long strands, was the lifeblood of this industry. Every year, thousands of wool sacks were sold to Flemish merchants, and the customs duties generated by this trade filled the English treasury.

However, the Count of Flanders was a subject of the French King, and King Philip ordered Flanders to cease trading with the English. The Flemish were as horrified as the English. Without English wool, their industry would collapse, and their people would starve.

**A King's Claim, a Nation's Destiny**

One Friday, in the bustling market square of Ghent in Flanders, the people gathered around a wooden stage adorned with colorful pennants and flags. They noticed a new flag: the arms of England quartered with the royal arms of France. A young, powerful man stepped forward. He declared his name: King Edward the Third. He had been wrongfully banned from his lands in France, and he would reclaim his right. The people cheered.

But there was more. By the right of his French mother, he was claiming the very throne of France itself. The Flemish cheered. The French giggled.

War was now inevitable. On the English side, the stakes were high: trade, England's role in Christendom, the King's lands in France held for a century and a half, and the reputation and honor of the King. On the French side, the prize was equally significant: a unified country, national prestige, and the right of their monarch to his throne.

Join us next time as these two great kings marshal their forces and the Hundred Years War begins in earnest.
