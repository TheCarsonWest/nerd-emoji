## APUSH Notecard: Maize Cultivation

### Period 1: 1491-1607

---

**Concept:** The cultivation of maize (corn) as a foundational agricultural practice that significantly shaped indigenous societies across the Americas prior to and during European contact.

---

**Key Details:**

*   **Origin:** Developed in Mesoamerica (modern-day Mexico) thousands of years before 1491.
*   **Spread:** Gradually diffused northward over centuries into the present-day American Southwest and then eastward into the Mississippi River Valley and Atlantic seaboard.
*   **Adaptation:** Indigenous peoples developed diverse agricultural techniques (e.g., irrigation in dry regions, "Three Sisters" planting in temperate zones) to adapt maize cultivation to various environments.

**Significance:**

1.  **Population Growth & Sedentary Lifestyles:** Maize provided a reliable, high-yield food source, enabling larger, more permanent settlements and population growth, reducing reliance on nomadic hunting and gathering.
2.  **Social Complexity:** Agricultural surpluses allowed for labor specialization, the development of sophisticated social structures, political organization, and elaborate religious ceremonies (e.g., development of chieftainships, stratified societies).
3.  **Cultural Development:** Led to the rise of complex civilizations and cultures, such as the Pueblo peoples in the Southwest and the Mississippian Mound Builders in the Mississippi River Valley.
4.  **Environmental Transformation:** Indigenous groups actively altered their environments (e.g., through irrigation canals, terracing, controlled burns) to support maize cultivation.
5.  **Pre-Columbian Diversity:** The varying adoption and adaptation of maize cultivation contributed to the immense diversity of Native American societies that Europeans encountered upon arrival.
