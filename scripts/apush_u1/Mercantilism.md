## APUSH Period 1: Mercantilism (1491-1607)

---

**Concept:** Mercantilism was the dominant economic theory and practice among European powers during the Age of Exploration and early colonization.

**Definition:** An economic system designed to maximize the wealth and power of the mother country by accumulating gold and silver (bullion) and establishing a favorable balance of trade (exports exceeding imports).

---

### Key Principles/Goals:

*   **Accumulation of Bullion:** Primary goal was to acquire and retain as much gold and silver as possible.
*   **Favorable Balance of Trade:** Exporting more goods than importing to ensure a net inflow of wealth.
*   **Colonial Role:** Colonies existed to provide raw materials (e.g., timber, furs, precious metals) to the mother country and serve as a captive market for finished goods.
*   **Government Control:** Heavy government regulation of the economy to achieve these goals (e.g., tariffs, monopolies).

### Period 1 Context (1491-1607):

*   **Driving Force:** Mercantilism was the fundamental motivation behind European exploration and the initial establishment of overseas empires. The search for new sources of wealth (especially gold and silver) fueled expeditions.
*   **Spanish Dominance:** Spain epitomized mercantilist practices in this period.
    *   **Key "Events":** Columbus's voyages, the conquests of the Aztec (Cortez) and Inca (Pizarro) empires, and the subsequent discovery and extraction of vast silver deposits (e.g., Potos√≠ in Bolivia) and gold from the Americas.
    *   **Key "People/Entities":** The Spanish Crown (Ferdinand & Isabella, Charles V) actively sponsored expeditions and established systems (like the `encomienda` and `repartimiento` labor systems) to exploit colonial resources for the benefit of Spain. Explorers like **Columbus, Cortez, and Pizzaro** acted as agents of this system.
*   **Early English/French/Dutch Actions:** While not yet establishing major, profitable colonies like Spain, their early expeditions (e.g., English search for a Northwest Passage, French fur trade interests) were also driven by mercantilist desires for new resources and trade routes to increase national wealth.

### Significance:

*   **Fueled Imperialism:** Directly led to intense competition and rivalries among European nations for colonial territories and resources.
*   **Shaped Colonial Economies:** Established a dependent relationship where colonies were limited in their economic development and primarily served the needs of the mother country.
*   **Foundation for Exploitation:** Laid the groundwork for centuries of colonial exploitation, resource extraction, and the transatlantic slave trade (to provide labor for resource production).
*   **Wealth Transfer:** Resulted in a massive transfer of wealth from the Americas to Europe, profoundly impacting European economies and societies.
