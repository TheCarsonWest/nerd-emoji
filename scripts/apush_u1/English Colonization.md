# APUSH Period 1: English Colonization (1491-1607)

## Context
*   England was a latecomer to colonization compared to Spain & Portugal.
*   **Motivations:**
    *   Rivalry with Catholic Spain (religious & imperial).
    *   Desire for wealth (gold, resources, new markets).
    *   Religious freedom/spread of Protestantism.
    *   "Safety valve" for growing population/poverty (though more impactful later).

## Key People & Their Roles
*   **John Cabot (1497):** First English explorer to claim land in North America (Newfoundland), setting an early precedent.
*   **Queen Elizabeth I (reigned 1558-1603):** Supported exploration, privateering against Spanish ships, and early colonization efforts.
*   **Sir Walter Raleigh (1580s):** Financed the failed Roanoke Island colonies, demonstrating the challenges of colonization.
*   **Richard Hakluyt (late 16th c.):** Wrote influential pamphlets advocating for colonization, emphasizing economic, religious, and political benefits for England.

## Key Events
*   **1497: John Cabot's Voyage:** Explored the coast of Newfoundland, claiming it for England, though no permanent settlement was established.
*   **1585-1590: Roanoke Island Colonies (The "Lost Colony"):**
    *   Series of attempts by Sir Walter Raleigh to establish a permanent settlement off the coast of North Carolina.
    *   **1587:** Final group of colonists arrived, led by John White.
    *   **1590:** White returned to find the colony deserted, with the word "Croatoan" carved into a tree. The fate of the colonists remains a mystery.

## Significance
*   **Early Failures:** Roanoke demonstrated the immense challenges of establishing colonies (logistics, supply, Native relations, disease).
*   **Lessons Learned:** Highlighted the need for better planning, sustained funding (leading to the later joint-stock company model), and a deeper understanding of the American environment.
*   **Foundation for Future Attempts:** Despite failures, this period established the *desire* and *theoretical framework* for English colonization, laying the groundwork for the successful settlements beginning in 1607 (Jamestown, which falls into Period 2 but is a direct result of these early lessons).
*   **Mercantilist Ideas:** Early promotion of colonies as sources of raw materials and markets for the mother country.
