# APUSH Period 1: European Rivalries (1491-1607)

---

### **Overview**
*   **Intense competition** among European powers (primarily Spain, Portugal, France, England) for land, resources, wealth, and religious dominance in the "New World."
*   Fueled by **mercantilism** (belief that colonies exist to benefit the mother country's wealth/power).

---

### **Key Players & Motivations**

*   **Spain:**
    *   **Goal:** Gold, silver, convert natives to Catholicism (God, Gold, Glory).
    *   **Early Dominance:** Columbus, Cort√©s, Pizarro. Established vast colonial empire in Central/South America.
*   **Portugal:**
    *   **Goal:** Control trade routes to Asia; less focus on large-scale colonization in Americas (except Brazil).
*   **France:**
    *   **Goal:** Fur trade, search for Northwest Passage, establish trading posts.
    *   **People:** **Giovanni da Verrazzano** (1524), **Jacques Cartier** (1530s).
    *   **Strategy:** Generally more cooperative with natives (for trade).
*   **England:**
    *   **Goal:** Initially lagged; later sought wealth, land, religious freedom (Protestant challenge to Catholic Spain).
    *   **People:** **John Cabot** (1497, early claims), **Sir Francis Drake** (privateer, raided Spanish ships), **Queen Elizabeth I** (supported privateering).
    *   **Early Attempts:** **Roanoke Colony** (1580s, failed).

### **Key Events & Concepts**

*   **Treaty of Tordesillas (1494):**
    *   Agreement between Spain and Portugal, brokered by Pope, to divide the "New World." Spain got lands west of the line, Portugal got lands east (including Brazil).
*   **Protestant Reformation (began 1517):**
    *   Increased religious tensions in Europe, especially between Catholic Spain and Protestant England.
    *   Motivated some English and French to seek religious freedom/challenge Spanish Catholic power.
*   **Spanish Armada (1588):**
    *   Spain's attempt to invade England. England's defeat of the Armada marked a **turning point.**
    *   **Significance:** Weakened Spanish naval power, boosted English confidence, and cleared the way for future English colonization efforts in North America.

### **Significance**

*   **Accelerated exploration and colonization:** Competition spurred nations to explore more rapidly.
*   **Diverse colonial models:** Led to different approaches to colonization (e.g., Spanish extractive, French trading, English settlement).
*   **Shifting Power Dynamics:** The defeat of the Spanish Armada marked the beginning of Spain's decline and England's rise as a naval and colonial power.
*   **Laid groundwork for future conflicts:** European rivalries in North America would continue for centuries (e.g., French & Indian War).
