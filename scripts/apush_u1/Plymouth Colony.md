### **Overview:**
*   **Founded:** 1620
*   **Location:** Plymouth, Massachusetts (Cape Cod area)
*   **Purpose:** Religious freedom for Separatists (Pilgrims)

### **Key People:**
*   **Pilgrims (Separatists):** English religious dissenters who wanted to *separate* completely from the Church of England.
*   **William Bradford:** Long-time governor of Plymouth, author of *Of Plimoth Plantation*, a primary source on the colony's early years.
*   **Miles Standish:** Military advisor for the colony.
*   **Squanto (Tisquantum):** Native American (Pawtuxet) who served as an interpreter and guide, teaching Pilgrims how to cultivate land and fish.
*   **Massasoit:** Sachem (chief) of the Wampanoag Confederacy, formed a crucial alliance with the Pilgrims.

### **Key Events & Documents:**
*   **1620: Mayflower Compact:** Signed by 41 male passengers before landing.
    *   **Significance:** First agreement for self-government in North America. Established a civil body politic and rules by majority consent.
*   **1620: Landing at Plymouth Rock:** Pilgrims arrived after a difficult voyage.
*   **Winter 1620-1621:** "Starving Time." Harsh winter led to high mortality rates due to disease and lack of food.
*   **Spring 1621:** Formation of alliance with Wampanoag, aided by Squanto.
*   **Autumn 1621: First Thanksgiving:** Harvest feast shared with Wampanoag, symbolizing temporary peace and cooperation.
*   **1691:** Plymouth Colony absorbed into the larger Massachusetts Bay Colony.

### **Significance:**
*   **Self-Government:** The **Mayflower Compact** set an important precedent for self-rule and constitutionalism in American development.
*   **Religious Freedom:** Served as an early model for colonies founded on the principle of religious liberty, though they were not tolerant of all faiths.
*   **Native American Relations:** Demonstrated early, complex interactions between Europeans and Native Americans, initially characterized by vital cooperation, but eventually leading to conflict (e.g., King Philip's War, though later).
*   **Perseverance:** Symbol of early American grit and survival against harsh conditions.
*   **New England Identity:** Contributed to the distinct socio-political and religious character of the New England colonies.
