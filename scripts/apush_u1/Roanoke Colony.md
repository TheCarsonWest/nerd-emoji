### **Key Events/Timeline:**

*   **1585:** First attempt to establish an English colony at Roanoke Island (present-day North Carolina); failed due to lack of supplies and conflicts with Native Americans.
*   **1587:** Second group of 100+ English settlers, led by John White, establishes the "Lost Colony" on Roanoke Island.
*   **1587:** John White returns to England for supplies, leaving the colonists behind.
*   **1588-1590:** Anglo-Spanish War delays White's return to Roanoke.
*   **1590:** White finally returns to find the colony deserted. The only clues were the word "CROATOAN" carved into a fence post and "CRO" on a tree, suggesting a possible move to Croatoan Island (now Hatteras Island). The fate of the colonists remains unknown.

### **Significance:**

*   **England's First Major Attempt:** Represents the earliest major English effort to establish a permanent New World settlement, preceding Jamestown (1607).
*   **"Lost Colony" Mystery:** Its unexplained disappearance became a lasting historical enigma, fueling theories about assimilation with Native Americans, disease, or attack.
*   **Lessons Learned:** Highlighted the immense challenges of early colonization: the difficulties of maintaining supply lines, harsh environmental conditions, and complex relations with Native American populations.
*   **Delayed Colonization:** The failure of Roanoke contributed to a temporary pause in large-scale English colonization efforts until the successful founding of Jamestown.
