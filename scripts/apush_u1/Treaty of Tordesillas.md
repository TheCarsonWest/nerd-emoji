## Treaty of Tordesillas

**Date:** June 7, 1494

**Key Players:**
*   **Spain:** Ferdinand II of Aragon & Isabella I of Castile (Catholic Monarchs)
*   **Portugal:** King John II
*   **Arbitrator:** Pope Alexander VI (via Papal Bull *Inter Caetera*, 1493, which was later modified by the treaty)

**What It Was:**
*   An agreement between Spain and Portugal dividing newly discovered lands outside of Europe.
*   **Purpose:** To prevent conflict and competition between the two Catholic powers over exploration and colonization rights, particularly after Columbus's initial voyages.

**The Division Line:**
*   Established a meridian **370 leagues (approx. 1,185 miles)** west of the Cape Verde Islands (off the coast of West Africa).
*   **Lands to the West:** Spain's sphere of influence (most of the Americas).
*   **Lands to the East:** Portugal's sphere of influence (Africa, Asia, and later, the coast of Brazil).

**Significance (APUSH):**
*   **Shaped Colonial Empires:** Directly led to Spain colonizing most of Latin America (Spanish-speaking) and Portugal colonizing Brazil (Portuguese-speaking).
*   **Avoided Immediate Conflict:** Successfully averted war between Spain and Portugal over initial discoveries.
*   **Ignored Indigenous Rights:** The treaty was drawn without any consideration for the millions of indigenous people already living in these lands.
*   **Challenged by Other Powers:** Other European nations (England, France, Netherlands) did not recognize the treaty and later pursued their own colonial ventures in the Americas, leading to future conflicts.
*   **Early European Imperialism:** A foundational example of European powers asserting claims over non-European territories based solely on discovery and papal decree.
