### APUSH Notecard: Period 1 - French Colonization (1491-1607)

**Key People & Events:**
*   **Jacques Cartier:**
    *   **1534, 1535-36, 1541-42:** Led voyages exploring the St. Lawrence River.
    *   Claimed the area around the St. Lawrence for France (future Canada).
    *   Searched for the Northwest Passage and valuable resources (gold, spices).
*   **No permanent settlements established** by France in this period. Early attempts failed due to harsh climate, disease, and Native resistance.
*   **Initial interactions with Indigenous Peoples:** Focused on exploration and establishing trade, laying the groundwork for future fur trade alliances (e.g., with Huron).

**Significance:**
*   **Established French territorial claims** in North America, particularly in the St. Lawrence River valley.
*   **Mapped important waterways,** crucial for future French expansion and the lucrative fur trade.
*   **Differed from Spanish model:** French efforts in this period were primarily exploratory and focused on finding a Northwest Passage, rather than large-scale conquest, settlement, or extraction of precious metals. This set a precedent for a more trade-oriented relationship with Native Americans.
*   **Motivation:** Driven by the pursuit of new trade routes (Northwest Passage), wealth, and national prestige.
