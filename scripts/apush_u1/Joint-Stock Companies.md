# APUSH Notecard: Joint-Stock Companies
## Period 1: 1491-1607

---

*   **What It Is:**
    *   A private business organization where investors buy shares (stocks) to pool money for large, risky ventures.
    *   **Goal:** Share profits, but also limit individual risk (**limited liability**). If the venture failed, an investor only lost the money they invested, not their entire fortune.

*   **Why Needed (Purpose in APUSH Period 1):**
    *   Funded early English colonization efforts.
    *   Overseas ventures (like establishing colonies) were incredibly expensive and risky; monarchs preferred private financing over full royal funding and debt.

*   **Key Example & Event:**
    *   **The Virginia Company of London** (est. 1606)
        *   Chartered by **King James I**.
        *   **Event:** Funded the establishment of **Jamestown (1607)**, the first permanent English settlement in North America.

*   **Key Players:**
    *   **Investors:** Primarily English merchants, gentry, and some aristocrats seeking profits from New World resources (gold, timber, furs) and new markets.
    *   **King James I:** Granted the charter that allowed the Virginia Company to operate.

*   **Significance:**
    *   **Enabled sustained English colonization** without massive government debt.
    *   Provided a **model for future colonial ventures** (though many early joint-stock colonies struggled financially).
    *   Laid the **groundwork for capitalist ventures** and private enterprise in the New World, shifting the focus from purely government-sponsored exploration to profit-driven settlement.
