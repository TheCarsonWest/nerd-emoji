# APUSH Period 1: Pre-Columbian Native American Tribes (c. 1491)

## **Core Idea:**
*   North America was home to **diverse, complex societies** with unique cultures, languages, and lifestyles, adapted to varied environments **before European arrival**. Not a monolithic group.

## **Key Themes/Developments:**
*   **Agriculture (Maize/Corn):** Spread from Mesoamerica (Mexico) across North America.
    *   Enabled **settled societies**, population growth, and social stratification.
    *   Often combined with "Three Sisters" (corn, beans, squash).
*   **Adaptation:** Indigenous peoples developed distinct cultures, political systems, and economies based on their specific environments and available resources.

## **Regional Examples & Characteristics:**

### 1. **Southwest (e.g., Pueblo, Anasazi/Ancestral Puebloans, Hohokam)**
*   **Environment:** Arid desert.
*   **Adaptations:** Advanced **irrigation systems**, multi-story **pueblos** (adobe dwellings), cliff dwellings.
*   **Economy:** Primarily maize agriculture.

### 2. **Mississippi River Valley (e.g., Cahokia, Mound Builders)**
*   **Environment:** Fertile river valleys.
*   **Adaptations:** Large, permanent settlements; monumental **earthen mounds** (ceremonial/burial); complex social hierarchies; extensive trade networks.
*   **Economy:** Agriculture. (Cahokia was a major urban center near present-day St. Louis, peaked c. 1050-1200 CE).

### 3. **Northeast / Eastern Woodlands (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy, Algonquian)**
*   **Environment:** Forested woodlands.
*   **Adaptations:** **Longhouses** (Iroquois); **slash-and-burn agriculture**; powerful political alliances (e.g., **Iroquois Confederacy** - a sophisticated democratic council of 5 (later 6) nations formed possibly in 15th century).
*   **Economy:** Mixed agriculture, hunting, gathering.

### 4. **Great Plains**
*   **Environment:** Vast grasslands.
*   **Adaptations:** Nomadic hunter-gatherers, heavily reliant on the **buffalo** (before the introduction of horses by Europeans). Lived in teepees.
*   **Economy:** Hunting (buffalo), gathering.

### 5. **Pacific Northwest (e.g., Chinook)**
*   **Environment:** Rich coastal and forest resources.
*   **Adaptations:** Abundant salmon/fish, timber; permanent settlements (despite not farming); elaborate social hierarchies; **totem poles**; **potlatches** (feasts for status display).
*   **Economy:** Fishing, hunting, gathering (forest resources).

## **Significance:**
*   **Challenged European notions:** Demonstrated that Native Americans were not "savages" but had developed sophisticated societies, technologies, and cultures.
*   **Influenced Colonization:** The diversity of tribes, their existing land claims, and various levels of political organization profoundly shaped European exploration, settlement patterns, and interactions (conflict, cooperation, trade).
*   **Sustainable Practices:** Many groups developed sustainable agricultural practices and resource management techniques adapted to their local environments.
