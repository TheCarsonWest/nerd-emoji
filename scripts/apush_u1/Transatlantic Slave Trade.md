# APUSH Notecard: Transatlantic Slave Trade (Period 1: 1491-1607)

---

## Definition:
*   The forced migration of **enslaved Africans** across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas, primarily for labor.
*   Part of the larger **Columbian Exchange**, but a forced demographic shift.

---

## Key Participants & Motivations:

*   **European Powers (Spain, Portugal first):**
    *   Driven by demand for cheap labor in the Americas, especially for cash crops like **sugar** on plantations.
    *   Native American populations decimated by disease and warfare, making them an unreliable labor source.
    *   Africans chosen due to:
        *   Resistance to Old World diseases (e.g., smallpox, measles).
        *   Experience with agriculture in their homelands.
        *   Lack of familiarity with the American landscape, making escape difficult.
        *   Racial ideologies that justified their enslavement.
*   **African Kingdoms/States:**
    *   Involved in capturing and selling enslaved people from rival groups to European traders on the coast. Often traded for European goods (guns, textiles).
*   **Enslaved Africans:**
    *   Forcibly removed from their homes, subjected to brutal conditions during capture, march to coast, and the **Middle Passage**.

## Key Events/Development (1491-1607):

*   **1440s:** Portugal initiates the trans-Saharan slave trade to Europe; establishes trading posts along West African coast.
*   **1502:** First enslaved Africans documented arriving in the Spanish colony of **Hispaniola**.
*   **1518:** First direct shipment of enslaved Africans from Africa to the Americas (Caribbean) begins, bypassing European stops.
*   **Early 16th Century:**
    *   **Asiento System:** Spain grants licenses (asientos) to other European powers (initially Portugal) to provide enslaved Africans to its colonies.
    *   Expansion of **sugar plantations** in the Caribbean and Brazil fueled the increasing demand.
    *   While the **English colonies** (e.g., Jamestown) were founded late in this period (1607), the transatlantic slave trade was already well-established by Spain and Portugal.

## Significance for Period 1:

*   **Foundation of Chattel Slavery:** Established the brutal system of generational, race-based slavery that would define much of American history.
*   **Economic Engine:** Provided the forced labor necessary for the extraction of resources and cultivation of highly profitable cash crops, enriching European empires.
*   **Demographic Shift:** Initiated a massive forced migration from Africa to the Americas, forever altering the demographics of both continents.
*   **Racial Hierarchy:** Contributed to the development of racial ideologies that placed Europeans at the top and Africans at the bottom of a social and economic hierarchy.
*   **Brutalization:** Set the precedent for the inhumane treatment and dehumanization of enslaved peoples.
