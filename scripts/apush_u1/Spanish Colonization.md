---

### **Motivations:** Gold, God, Glory (3 G's)

*   **Gold:** Acquire wealth (bullion, resources) to fund empire.
*   **God:** Spread Catholicism and convert Native populations.
*   **Glory:** Expand Spanish Empire, gain prestige for the monarchy.

### **Key Figures & Explorers:**

*   **Christopher Columbus (1492):** Reached the Caribbean, initiating European colonization of the Americas.
*   **Hernán Cortés (1519-1521):** Conquered the Aztec Empire in Mexico.
*   **Francisco Pizarro (1532):** Conquered the Inca Empire in Peru.
*   **Bartolomé de Las Casas:** Dominican friar; criticized the mistreatment of Native Americans (e.g., in *A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies*).

### **Key Systems & Policies:**

*   **Columbian Exchange:** Massive transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, diseases, and ideas between the Americas, West Africa, and the Old World.
    *   **From Old World to New:** Horses, cattle, pigs, wheat, rice, coffee, **diseases** (smallpox, measles, influenza).
    *   **From New World to Old:** Corn (maize), potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, cacao, syphilis.
*   **Encomienda System:** Spanish Crown granted colonists authority over specific Native populations, demanding labor/tribute in exchange for protection & Christian conversion. (Often brutal exploitation).
*   **Casta System:** Rigid social hierarchy based on racial purity (e.g., Peninsulares, Creoles, Mestizos, Mulattoes, Native Americans, Enslaved Africans).
*   **Mission System:** Efforts to convert Natives to Catholicism and assimilate them into Spanish culture. (Often forced, leading to resistance).

### **Significance/Impact:**

*   **Demographic Catastrophe:** Old World diseases (smallpox, measles) devastated Native populations (up to 90% decline).
*   **Wealth for Spain:** Silver (e.g., Potosí) and gold fueled European commerce but also led to inflation.
*   **Forced Labor:** Led to widespread enslavement of Natives (encomienda, repartimiento), and later the importation of enslaved Africans due to Native population decline.
*   **Cultural Blending & Conflict:** Emergence of new mixed-race populations (mestizos), syncretism (blending of cultures/religions) alongside violent suppression of Native practices.
*   **Precedent for Colonization:** Established models of conquest, resource extraction, and social hierarchy that other European powers (English, French, Dutch) would later adapt or react against.
