## APUSH Period 1: Virginia Company (1491-1607)

---

**What it Was:**
*   English joint-stock company chartered by King James I.
*   **Purpose:** To establish colonies in North America for profit (gold, other resources, potential Northwest Passage) and compete with Spain.

**Key Dates/Events:**
*   **1606:** Granted a royal charter by King James I.
*   **1607:** Established **Jamestown, Virginia**, the first permanent English settlement in North America.
*   **Initial Struggles (1607 onwards):** Faced immense challenges including disease (malaria, dysentery), famine (the "Starving Time" largely begins just after 1607 but its roots are here), and hostile relations with the **Powhatan Confederacy** (local Native American tribe).

**Key People:**
*   **King James I:** Granted the charter, hoping for wealth and expansion of English influence.
*   **English Investors/Merchants:** Funded the company, seeking financial returns.
*   **John Smith:** Early leader at Jamestown; imposed strict discipline ("no work, no eat") crucial for the colony's survival in its initial years (present in 1607).

**Significance (within Period 1):**
*   **First Permanent English Colony:** Successfully established Jamestown, laying the groundwork for English colonization in the Americas.
*   **Joint-Stock Model:** Pioneered this new economic model for funding overseas ventures, distributing risk among investors.
*   **Early Native American Relations:** Marked the beginning of sustained, and often conflict-ridden, interactions between English settlers and Native American tribes in North America (specifically the Powhatan).
*   **Foundation for Chesapeake:** Set the stage for the development of the Chesapeake Bay region, even though its later economic and social structures (tobacco, slavery) fully emerge after 1607.
