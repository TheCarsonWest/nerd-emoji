The U.S. Asylum System: Who Gets In, And Who Gets Turned Away?

The current situation at the U.S. border has brought the issue of asylum into the spotlight.  Thousands of Central American families are fleeing violence and seeking asylum in the U.S., leading to a complex and often heart-wrenching debate.

**What is Asylum?**

Asylum is granted to individuals who have a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.  This definition originates from a 1951 UN agreement, later incorporated into U.S. law with the 1980 Refugee Act.  Asylum seekers differ from refugees in that they apply for protection while at the U.S. border or already within the country, often on a temporary visa.

**The Current Crisis:**

While illegal border crossings are at historic lows, asylum requests from Central America have surged.  This increase is attributed by some to a humanitarian crisis fueled by escalating violence and gang activity in the region. Others argue that immigrants are exploiting the asylum system, leading to fraudulent claims and a massive court backlog.

**The Asylum Process:**

* **Credible Fear Screening:**  Upon arrival, asylum seekers undergo a screening interview with an immigration agent to determine if they have a legitimate fear of persecution.
* **Immigration Judge Hearing:**  If credible fear is established, the applicant receives a hearing with an immigration judge, who makes the final decision on asylum.
* **Long Waits and Uncertainty:**  Due to a backlog of over 300,000 cases, applicants often face long waits for their hearings.  Success rates are low; in 2016, fewer than 21,000 individuals were granted asylum out of over 92,000 credible fear claims.
* **Inconsistencies and Bias:** Studies suggest that asylum decisions can be influenced by the judge's location and political leanings, with higher approval rates in liberal areas compared to conservative ones.

**Recent Policy Changes:**

Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently declared that gang violence and domestic abuse no longer qualify as grounds for asylum. This change significantly impacts applicants from the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras), regions plagued by high crime rates and gang violence.  This policy change is highly contested.

**Key Questions and Debate:**

* What constitutes legitimate persecution?
* Should asylum be limited to political or religious persecution, as originally intended?
* How can the U.S. balance border security with the humanitarian needs of asylum seekers?
* Can the asylum system be reformed to address the backlog and ensure fairness?


The asylum system is a complex issue with no easy answers.  It requires a careful balancing act between protecting our borders and upholding our humanitarian obligations to those fleeing persecution.
