## The Arab Slave Trade: A 1300-Year History

The Arab slave trade, a vast and enduring system, spanned centuries and involved millions of individuals. While not solely perpetrated by Arabs, their central role in the network, controlling key markets and raiding parties, justifies the term "Arab Slave Trade."  This trade extended far beyond East Africa, encompassing diverse routes and regions.

**Historical Context and Islamic Law:**

Slavery existed in Arabia prior to Islam.  The Quran did not abolish slavery but introduced regulations later expanded upon by caliphs.  Individuals could become enslaved through birth, capture during Jihad (holy war against non-Muslims), purchase, or tribute. Importantly, enslavement of Muslims or those under Islamic rule was generally prohibited except in cases of rebellion or treason.

**Ethnic Variations in Enslavement:**

The enslaved population within the Islamic world was diverse, encompassing various ethnicities, each perceived to possess specific advantages.  While Africans were a significant portion of the enslaved,  others, including Indians, Nubians, Turks, and Slavs, were also enslaved and often assigned roles based on perceived abilities (e.g., Nubians as guards, Zanj as laborers). A key distinction existed between "Mamluks" (white slaves) and "Abd" (black slaves), with Mamluks having greater opportunities for social mobility and even forming their own dynasties, unlike Abd slaves.

**The Growth of the African Slave Trade:**

The number of African slaves within the system increased disproportionately over time. Factors contributing to this shift included the stabilization of Islamic frontiers, the conversion of Turks and Indians to Islam (reducing their availability as slaves), and a decline in Jihad after the 8th century.  Conquests across the Sahara opened new trade routes, facilitating the movement of slaves, along with religious and cultural ideas, across the African continent.

**Key Trade Routes and Centers:**

The Zanj coast (modern Kenya and Tanzania) became a major hub, supplying slaves to Yemen, Oman, the Persian Gulf, and cities like Basra and Baghdad.  The Somali coast also played a crucial role, exporting slaves to Yemen and beyond.  The appalling conditions in places like Mesopotamian plantations and saltpeter mines led to numerous slave revolts.

Mecca, Islam's holiest city, unfortunately, became a significant slave market, with slaves sold during the Hajj pilgrimage. This practice continued until 1962.

**The Scale of the Trade:**

The Arab slave trade drew slaves primarily from central and western Sudan, with Nubia serving as a major source.  Other regions, including Kanem-Borno, the Lake Chad area, the Middle Niger, and the Atlantic coast, also contributed to the slave supply.  Berber groups, like the Tuareg and Moors, became central agents in raiding and trafficking slaves across North Africa, Spain, Turkey, and even to the Mediterranean and beyond.  Historians estimate that for every slave reaching a market, ten perished en route.  Raids were often justified as Jihad, masking their true predatory nature.

**The Later Period and Abolition:**

The 18th and 19th centuries witnessed the peak of the Arab slave trade, coinciding with the rise of the ivory trade.  While European countries abolished slavery and the slave trade from around 1800, the Arab slave trade continued.  British efforts to suppress it largely failed, potentially even increasing the trade in some areas.  Eventually, colonization and the weakening of Muslim states, coupled with international pressure, brought about the gradual demise of the trade.  However, slavery, in various forms, persists in some regions to this day.

**Comparative Scale:**

Estimates suggest that between 1450 and 1850, approximately 12 million African slaves were transported to the Americas by Europeans.  During a similar period, an estimated 5 million were traded by Muslims. Considering the much longer duration of the Arab slave trade (600-1900 CE), the total number of slaves involved is estimated to be around 17 million.

This overview provides a glimpse into the complex and devastating history of the Arab slave trade, underscoring its vast scale, enduring impact, and the need for continued historical examination.
