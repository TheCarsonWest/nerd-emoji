## Food Apartheid in Southeast D.C.: Toni Lawson's Fight for Food Justice

Toni Lawson, a 71-year-old resident of Southeast Washington, D.C., embodies the struggle faced by millions of Americans living in food deserts.  Her daily life is a testament to the systemic inequities that create these areas of limited access to affordable, healthy food.  Retiring from a career in insurance ten years ago, Toni relies on food stamps, received on the 6th of each month, to feed herself.  A simple forgotten grocery bag highlights the larger systemic issue.  The inconvenience of retrieving the bag isn't just a minor setback; it underscores the significant challenges she faces simply accessing groceries.

Living more than a mile from the nearest grocery store, with no access to a vehicle, Toni's weekly grocery shopping trip is a significant undertaking.  She relies on two buses, spending 40 minutes each way to reach her nearest option – a journey that becomes increasingly arduous with age and the physical strain of carrying a week’s worth of groceries.  This is the reality for Toni and the 150,000 residents of Southeast D.C., many of whom reside in a community identified by the USDA as a food desert.

The lack of grocery stores in Southeast D.C. is not accidental.  It's a deliberate consequence of systemic inequalities, what many are now calling "food apartheid."  While wealthier, predominantly white neighborhoods boast an abundance of supermarkets and big-box stores, Southeast D.C. is largely underserved. Major grocery chains cite low profit margins and higher crime rates as deterrents to establishing stores in the area.  This leaves residents with limited options, primarily fast food and convenience stores, perpetuating a cycle of poor health and economic hardship.

Toni's grocery shopping routine is a constant search for the best deals, requiring her to travel across the city to different stores.  Even the nearest Giant supermarket proves too expensive for her budget.  "There’s not a lot of places in the area where I live that I can go and buy food," she explains. "What I do is I buy my bulk when I get my stamps. I run all over the city."

This exhausting reality has spurred Toni into action.  She's actively training to become a community advocate, lobbying the D.C. government to incentivize grocery stores to invest in underserved neighborhoods. Her goal is simple, yet profound: to bring a full-service supermarket to Ward 8, where she has resided for 21 years, a neighborhood that has been without one for her entire time living there.  "In my area, I want to see more places for people to shop," she states.

Toni Lawson's story is more than a personal struggle; it's a stark indictment of a system that perpetuates food insecurity. Her advocacy highlights the urgent need for policy changes that address the root causes of food apartheid and ensure equitable access to healthy, affordable food for all communities, regardless of race or socioeconomic status.  Her fight for better grocery access is a fight for food justice, a fight for the well-being of her community and millions of others facing similar challenges across the nation.
