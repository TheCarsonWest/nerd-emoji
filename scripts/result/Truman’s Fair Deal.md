Okay, here's a notecard on Truman's Fair Deal, formatted for APUSH review:

## ID: Truman's Fair Deal

## WHEN: 1945-1953 (Truman's Presidency)

## WHO:
*   **President Harry S. Truman:** The primary architect and advocate.
*   **Congress:** Both the Democratically controlled Congress (early years) and more conservative Congresses (later years) influenced the fate of the legislation.
*   **Labor Unions:** Supported expansion of worker protections and social programs.
*   **Civil Rights Activists:** Pushed for the inclusion of civil rights legislation.
*   **Southern Democrats:** Often opposed expansion of civil rights.

## WHAT:

A comprehensive set of proposals put forth by President Truman, building upon FDRâ€™s New Deal. Its goals were to expand economic opportunity, improve social welfare, and protect civil rights. Key proposals included:

*   **Increased Minimum Wage:** Raising the federal minimum wage.
*   **Expanded Social Security:** Broadening coverage and benefits under Social Security.
*   **Public Housing and Slum Clearance:** Funding for low-income housing and urban redevelopment.
*   **National Health Insurance:** A system of universal health coverage.
*   **Federal Protection of Civil Rights:** Legislation to protect voting rights, end segregation, and prevent discrimination.
*   **Increased Aid to Education:** Federal funds for schools.
*   **Repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act:**  A labor law Truman opposed.
*   **Price Controls:**  Maintain price controls to fight inflation after WWII.
## IMPACT:

*   **Limited Success:** While some elements were enacted (minimum wage increase, Social Security expansion, Housing Act of 1949), many key proposals like national health insurance and comprehensive civil rights legislation were defeated by Congress, largely due to opposition from Southern [[Democrats]] and conservative Republicans.
*   **Laid the Groundwork:** The Fair Deal established a liberal agenda and set the stage for future reforms during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the Great Society. It kept the ideals of the [[New Deal]] alive.
*   **Continued the Expansion of the Welfare State:** Reinforced the role of the federal government in providing a safety net and promoting social and economic well-being.
*   **Raised Expectations:** Despite its limitations, the Fair Deal raised public expectations for government action to address social and economic inequalities, influencing future political debates.
*   **Housing Act of 1949:** Provided funding for urban renewal projects. However, this often led to the displacement of low-income communities and the construction of highways and other infrastructure projects, with unintended negative consequences.
