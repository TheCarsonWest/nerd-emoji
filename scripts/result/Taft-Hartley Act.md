## ID: [[Taft-Hartley Act]] 
## WHEN: June 23, 1947

## WHO:
*   **Congress:** Primarily Republican-controlled Congress.
*   **President:** Initially vetoed by President Harry Truman (later overridden by Congress).
*   **Labor Unions:** Targeted the power of labor unions.

## WHAT:
A federal law that amended the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935. Its main provisions included:

*   Outlawed the "closed shop" (requiring workers to be union members before being hired).
*   Permitted states to pass "right-to-work" laws (prohibiting union security agreements).
*   Banned jurisdictional strikes and secondary boycotts.
*   Required union leaders to take oaths that they were not communists.
*   Authorized the President to obtain injunctions to prevent strikes that threatened national health or safety (80-day "cooling-off" period).
* Restricted union contributions to political campaigns.

## IMPACT: Why Significant?:
*   **Weakened Labor Unions:** Significantly curtailed the power and influence of labor unions, reversing some gains made during the [[New Deal]] era.
*   **Right-to-Work States:** Led to the proliferation of right-to-work laws in many states, particularly in the South, which further hampered union organizing.
*   **Political Impact:** Fuelled debate about labor rights and government regulation of the economy. Solidified a conservative backlash against the perceived excesses of the [[New Deal]] and the growing power of unions.
*   **Truman's Veto:** Truman's initial veto, though overridden, solidified his support among labor unions and contributed to his unexpected victory in the 1948 election.
*   **Long-Term Decline of Union Membership:** Contributed to the long-term decline of union membership in the United States.
