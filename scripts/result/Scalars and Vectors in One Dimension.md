# AP Physics 1.1: Scalars and Vectors in One Dimension

Understanding the nature of physical quantities is fundamental to physics. Quantities can be broadly categorized into two types: scalars and vectors. This distinction is crucial for accurately describing motion and interactions.

## I. Scalars

A **scalar** quantity is completely defined by its *magnitude* alone. It tells "how much" of something there is, but does not include any directional information.

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Has only a numerical value (magnitude).
    *   Always positive in standard contexts (e.g., mass, time).
    *   Follows standard arithmetic rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

*   **Examples:**
    *   **Distance:** The total path length covered, regardless of direction.
    *   **Speed:** The rate at which an object covers distance.
    *   **Mass:** A measure of an object's inertia.
    *   **Time:** The duration of an event.
    *   Temperature, energy, work, power.

## II. Vectors

A **vector** quantity is defined by both its *magnitude* and its *direction*. It tells "how much" and "in which way."

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Has both a numerical value (magnitude) and a specific direction.
    *   Requires special rules for addition, subtraction, and multiplication to account for direction.
    *   Represented graphically by an arrow where the length of the arrow indicates the magnitude and the arrowhead indicates the direction.
    *   Symbolically represented by a bold letter (e.g., $\mathbf{A}$) or a letter with an arrow above it (e.g., $\vec{A}$).

*   **Examples:**
    *   **Displacement:** The change in an object's position from a starting point to an ending point, including direction.
    *   **Velocity:** The rate of change of an object's displacement.
    *   **Acceleration:** The rate of change of an object's velocity.
    *   Force, momentum, electric field.

## III. Scalars vs. Vectors: A Comparison

| Feature      | Scalar                                   | Vector                                   |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Magnitude only                           | Magnitude and Direction                  |
| **Example**  | Distance (e.g., 5 m)                     | Displacement (e.g., 5 m East)            |
| **Arithmetic** | Standard arithmetic operations           | Vector arithmetic rules                  |
| **Symbol**   | Plain letter (e.g., $d$, $m$, $t$)       | Bold letter or arrow (e.g., $\vec{v}$, $\mathbf{F}$) |
| **Graphical**| No graphical representation              | Arrow                                    |

## IV. Representing Vectors in One Dimension

In one dimension, vectors are typically represented along a single axis (e.g., x-axis). Their direction is indicated by a positive or negative sign.

*   **Magnitude:** The absolute value of the vector's component. For example, a displacement of $-5 \text{ m}$ has a magnitude of $5 \text{ m}$.
*   **Direction:** Indicated by the sign.
    *   Positive sign ($+$): Often represents movement to the right, up, or forward.
    *   Negative sign ($-$): Often represents movement to the left, down, or backward.

For example, if we define "right" as positive:
*   A velocity of $+10 \text{ m/s}$ means $10 \text{ m/s}$ to the right.
*   A velocity of $-10 \text{ m/s}$ means $10 \text{ m/s}$ to the left.

## V. Vector Operations in One Dimension

### A. Vector Addition and Subtraction
When adding or subtracting vectors in one dimension, you simply combine their magnitudes, taking their directions (signs) into account.

Let $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ be two vectors along the x-axis.
*   **Addition:** $\vec{R} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}$
    *   If $\vec{A} = +5 \text{ m}$ and $\vec{B} = +3 \text{ m}$, then $\vec{R} = (+5 \text{ m}) + (+3 \text{ m}) = +8 \text{ m}$.
    *   If $\vec{A} = +5 \text{ m}$ and $\vec{B} = -3 \text{ m}$, then $\vec{R} = (+5 \text{ m}) + (-3 \text{ m}) = +2 \text{ m}$.
    *   If $\vec{A} = -5 \text{ m}$ and $\vec{B} = +3 \text{ m}$, then $\vec{R} = (-5 \text{ m}) + (+3 \text{ m}) = -2 \text{ m}$.
*   **Subtraction:** $\vec{R} = \vec{A} - \vec{B} = \vec{A} + (-\vec{B})$
    *   Subtracting a vector is equivalent to adding its negative. The negative of a vector has the same magnitude but the opposite direction.
    *   If $\vec{A} = +5 \text{ m}$ and $\vec{B} = +3 \text{ m}$, then $\vec{R} = (+5 \text{ m}) - (+3 \text{ m}) = +2 \text{ m}$.
    *   If $\vec{A} = +5 \text{ m}$ and $\vec{B} = -3 \text{ m}$, then $\vec{R} = (+5 \text{ m}) - (-3 \text{ m}) = (+5 \text{ m}) + (+3 \text{ m}) = +8 \text{ m}$.

### B. Multiplication by a Scalar
Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes its magnitude and potentially its direction.
*   If a scalar $c$ is positive, $c\vec{A}$ has the same direction as $\vec{A}$ but its magnitude is multiplied by $c$.
*   If a scalar $c$ is negative, $c\vec{A}$ has the opposite direction of $\vec{A}$ and its magnitude is multiplied by $|c|$.

For example, if $\vec{v} = +5 \text{ m/s}$:
*   $2\vec{v} = +10 \text{ m/s}$
*   $-3\vec{v} = -15 \text{ m/s}$
