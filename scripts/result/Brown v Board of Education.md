## ID: Brown v. Board of Education

## When: May 17, 1954

## Who:
*   **Plaintiffs:** Oliver Brown (on behalf of his daughter Linda Brown) and other African American families
*   **Defendant:** Board of Education of Topeka, [[Kansas]] *   **Supreme Court:** Led by Chief Justice Earl Warren
*   **NAACP:** Thurgood Marshall (lead attorney) and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund

## What:
A landmark Supreme Court case in which the Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students unconstitutional, overturning the "separate but equal" doctrine established in *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896). The case consolidated several similar cases from different states.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
*   **Overturned *Plessy v. Ferguson*:** Directly challenged and invalidated the legal basis for segregation in public education.
*   **Catalyst for Civil Rights Movement:** Served as a major legal victory and inspiration for the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. It demonstrated the potential of legal action to dismantle segregation.
*   **Implementation Challenges:** Despite the ruling, desegregation faced massive resistance, especially in the South. This led to further legal battles and federal intervention (e.g., Little Rock Nine).
*   **Expansion of Civil Rights:** The legal arguments used in *Brown v. Board* were later applied to challenge other forms of segregation and discrimination, extending the scope of civil rights protections.
*   **Equal Protection Clause:** Reinforced the importance of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause in guaranteeing equal rights and opportunities for all citizens.
