## Regex Groups and Backreferences

### What are Regex Groups and Backreferences?
Groups in regular expressions are used to capture substrings within the matched pattern. Backreferences allow referencing these captured substrings within the regular expression itself or in subsequent processing.

### How to Use Regex Groups
To create a group in a regular expression, use parentheses:

```
# capture the word "python"
(python)
```

Backreferences are used by escaping the opening parenthesis of the group:

```
# replace "Python" with "Py"
Python -> (Py)thon
```

### Code Examples
```python
import re

# find all occurrences of phone numbers
phone_pattern = re.compile(r"(\d{3}-?\d{3}-?\d{4})")

# match a string
match = phone_pattern.search("My phone number is 123-456-7890")

# access the captured group
phone_number = match.group(1)
```

### Related Python Concepts

- [[Regular Expressions]]: Groups and backreferences are core components of regular expressions.
- [[Functions]]: Regular expressions often use matching functions like `search` and `findall`.
- [[Lambda Functions]]: Regular expressions can be used as arguments to lambda functions.
- [[Sets]]: Groups can be used to construct sets of matched substrings.
- [[Tuples]]: Backreferences return tuples containing the captured substrings.
