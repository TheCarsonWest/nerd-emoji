# AP Physics 1.3: Representing Motion

Representing motion is fundamental to understanding how objects move. It involves describing an object's position, how that position changes over time, and the rate at which it changes. This topic lays the groundwork for analyzing more complex motion scenarios.

## 1. Key Quantities in Motion

To describe motion, we use several essential quantities:

### Position ($x$)
Position is the location of an object at a particular instant. It is a vector quantity, though in one dimension, we often use a single coordinate (e.g., $x$) relative to a chosen origin.

### Distance
Distance is a scalar quantity representing the total path length traveled by an object. It does not consider direction.

### Displacement ($\Delta x$)
Displacement is a vector quantity defined as the change in an object's position. It is the straight-line distance and direction from the initial position to the final position.
$
\Delta x = x_f - x_i
$
Where $x_f$ is the final position and $x_i$ is the initial position. Displacement can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the direction and if the object returns to its starting point.

**[[Scalars and Vectors in One Dimension]]**: It's crucial to distinguish between scalar quantities (like distance and speed) and vector quantities (like position, displacement, and velocity) which have both magnitude and direction.

## 2. Rates of Motion

How quickly an object moves is described by its speed and velocity.

### Speed
Speed is a scalar quantity that measures how fast an object is moving, defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.
$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
$

### Velocity ($\vec{v}$)
Velocity is a vector quantity that describes both the rate at which an object changes its position and its direction of motion.

#### Average Velocity
Average velocity is the total displacement divided by the total time interval over which the displacement occurred.
$
\vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec{x}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{x}_f - \vec{x}_i}{t_f - t_i}
$
The unit for velocity is meters per second (m/s).

#### Instantaneous Velocity
Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of an object at a specific instant in time. It is the limit of the average velocity as the time interval approaches zero. On a position-time graph, instantaneous velocity is represented by the slope of the tangent line at a particular point.
$
\vec{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec{x}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt}
$
[[Reference Frames and Relative Motion]] also play a role in how velocity is perceived and measured.

## 3. Representing Motion Graphically

Motion can be effectively visualized and analyzed using graphs.

### Position-Time Graphs ($x-t$ graphs)
*   **Vertical Axis:** Position ($x$)
*   **Horizontal Axis:** Time ($t$)
*   **Slope:** The slope of an $x-t$ graph represents the object's **velocity**.
    *   A straight line indicates constant velocity.
    *   A curved line indicates changing velocity (acceleration).
    *   A positive slope means positive velocity (moving in the positive direction).
    *   A negative slope means negative velocity (moving in the negative direction).
    *   A horizontal line (zero slope) means zero velocity (the object is at rest).

### Velocity-Time Graphs ($v-t$ graphs)
*   **Vertical Axis:** Velocity ($v$)
*   **Horizontal Axis:** Time ($t$)
*   **Slope:** The slope of a $v-t$ graph represents the object's **acceleration**.
*   **Area Under the Curve:** The area between the $v-t$ graph and the time axis represents the object's **displacement**.
    *   Area above the $t$-axis is positive displacement.
    *   Area below the $t$-axis is negative displacement.

Here's a summary of common motion scenarios on graphs:

| Motion Type          | Position-Time ($x-t$) Graph | Velocity-Time ($v-t$) Graph |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **At Rest**          | Horizontal line             | Line on $t$-axis ($v=0$)    |
| **Constant Positive Velocity** | Upward sloping straight line | Horizontal line above $t$-axis ($v>0$) |
| **Constant Negative Velocity** | Downward sloping straight line | Horizontal line below $t$-axis ($v<0$) |
| **Constant Positive Acceleration** | Upward curving parabola (concave up) | Upward sloping straight line ($a>0$) |
| **Constant Negative Acceleration** | Downward curving parabola (concave down) | Downward sloping straight line ($a<0$) |

## 4. Motion Diagrams

Motion diagrams represent an object's position at successive equal time intervals using dots or images, often with velocity vectors indicating the direction and relative magnitude of velocity.
*   **Spacing of dots:** Indicates speed. Closer dots mean slower speed; farther apart dots mean faster speed.
*   **Arrows:** Can be added to show the direction of velocity (from one dot to the next) or acceleration.

This provides a visual, intuitive way to understand the motion of an object without needing to plot a full graph.
