# AP Physics Notes: Topic 8.1 - Internal Structure and Density

## 1. Introduction to Density

Density ($\rho$) is a fundamental physical property of matter that quantifies how much "stuff" is packed into a given space. It is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance. Understanding density is crucial for analyzing the behavior of [[Fluids and Newtonâ€™s Laws]] and [[Fluids and Conservation Laws]].

The formula for density is:

$
\rho = \frac{m}{V}
$

Where:
*   $\rho$ (rho) is the density.
*   $m$ is the mass of the substance.
*   $V$ is the volume occupied by the substance.

### 1.1 Units of Density

The SI unit for density is kilograms per cubic meter ($\text{kg/m}^3$). However, grams per cubic centimeter ($\text{g/cm}^3$) or grams per milliliter ($\text{g/mL}$) are also commonly used, especially for liquids and solids.

$
1 \text{ g/cm}^3 = 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3
$

### 1.2 Factors Affecting Density

Density is an intensive property, meaning it does not depend on the amount of substance present. However, it can be affected by external conditions:

*   **Temperature**: Most substances expand when heated, increasing their volume and thus decreasing their density (assuming mass remains constant). Water is a notable exception around $4^\circ \text{C}$.
*   **Pressure**: Increasing pressure typically compresses a substance, decreasing its volume and thereby increasing its density. This effect is more pronounced in gases than in liquids or solids.
*   **Phase**: The phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) significantly impacts its density. Solids are generally denser than liquids, which are much denser than gases for the same substance.

## 2. Internal Structure and Density

The density of a substance is directly related to its [[Atomic Arrangement and Intermolecular Forces]].
Essentially, it depends on two primary factors at the microscopic level:

1.  **Mass of the constituent particles**: Heavier atoms or molecules will contribute to a higher density for a given packing efficiency.
2.  **Packing efficiency (intermolecular spacing)**: How closely the atoms or molecules are packed together.
    *   **Solids**: Particles are tightly packed in a fixed, regular arrangement (crystalline) or irregular arrangement (amorphous). Strong intermolecular forces keep them close, resulting in high densities.
    *   **Liquids**: Particles are still relatively close but can move past each other. The packing is less rigid than in solids, leading to slightly lower densities than their solid counterparts (with water being a key exception, as ice is less dense than liquid water).
    *   **Gases**: Particles are far apart and move randomly. There is a lot of empty space between particles, resulting in very low densities.

For example, consider iron (Fe) versus aluminum (Al). Iron atoms are heavier and can pack efficiently, leading to a higher density than aluminum, even though both are metals.

## 3. Specific Gravity

Specific gravity (SG) is a dimensionless quantity that compares the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance, usually water at $4^\circ \text{C}$ (where its density is approximately $1000 \text{ kg/m}^3$ or $1 \text{ g/cm}^3$).

$
SG = \frac{\rho_{\text{substance}}}{\rho_{\text{water, } 4^\circ \text{C}}}
$

Specific gravity is useful because it directly indicates whether an object will float or sink in water:
*   $SG < 1$: The substance is less dense than water and will float.
*   $SG > 1$: The substance is denser than water and will sink.
*   $SG = 1$: The substance has the same density as water and will be neutrally buoyant.

### 3.1 Example Densities

Here's a table of approximate densities for common substances:
