# AP Physics 1: Topic 2.3 - Newton’s Third Law

Newton's Third Law, often stated as "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction," is a fundamental principle describing the interaction between two objects. It is crucial for understanding how forces manifest in systems and for constructing accurate [[Free-Body Diagrams]].

## I. Statement of Newton's Third Law

When two objects interact, the force that object 1 exerts on object 2 is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that object 2 exerts on object 1.

Mathematically, if object A exerts a force $\vec{F}_{A \text{ on } B}$ on object B, then object B simultaneously exerts a force $\vec{F}_{B \text{ on } A}$ on object A, such that:

$
\vec{F}_{A \text{ on } B} = -\vec{F}_{B \text{ on } A}
$

**Key Points:**
*   Forces always come in pairs. You cannot have a single, isolated force.
*   The two forces in an action-reaction pair always act on *different* objects. This is a critical distinction from forces acting on a single object in [[Newton’s Second Law]].
*   The forces in a pair are always of the same type (e.g., both gravitational, both normal, both frictional).

## II. Characteristics of Action-Reaction Pairs

Understanding the properties of these force pairs is essential for correctly applying the law.

1.  **Equal Magnitude:** The strength of the force is the same for both objects. If you push a wall with 100 N of force, the wall pushes back on you with 100 N of force.
2.  **Opposite Direction:** The forces always point in exactly opposite directions along the line connecting the two objects.
3.  **Simultaneous:** The forces occur at the exact same instant. There is no delay.
4.  **Act on Different Objects:** This is perhaps the most crucial point. An action force acts on one object, and its reaction force acts on the *other* object involved in the interaction. This is why these forces *never* cancel each other out when considering the net force on a single object.

## III. Examples of Newton's Third Law

Let's illustrate with common scenarios:

| Interaction Pair                       | Action Force                               | Reaction Force                                    | Objects Involved   |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :----------------- |
| **Person pushing a wall**              | Wall pushes back on person                 | Person pushes on wall                             | Person, Wall       |
| **Book on a table**                    | Table pushes up on book (Normal Force)     | Book pushes down on table (Normal Force)          | Book, Table        |
| **Earth orbiting the Sun**             | Sun pulls on Earth (Gravitational Force)   | Earth pulls on Sun (Gravitational Force)          | Earth, Sun         |
| **Rocket propulsion**                  | Rocket pushes gas backward                 | Gas pushes rocket forward                         | Rocket, Exhaust Gas|
| **Swimming**                           | Swimmer pushes water backward              | Water pushes swimmer forward                      | Swimmer, Water     |

## IV. Distinguishing Action-Reaction Pairs from Balanced Forces

It's a common misconception to confuse action-reaction pairs with balanced forces.

*   **Action-Reaction Pairs:**
    *   Act on *different* objects.
    *   Cannot cancel each other out for the *same* object.
    *   Always equal and opposite, by definition of the third law.
    *   Examples: Force of Earth on Moon and Force of Moon on Earth.

*   **Balanced Forces:**
    *   Act on the *same* object.
    *   Cancel each other out, resulting in zero [[Newton’s Second Law]] (zero acceleration).
    *   Not necessarily equal and opposite (they just happen to sum to zero).
    *   Examples: For a book at rest on a table, the upward normal force from the table on the book and the downward gravitational force from Earth on the book are balanced forces *on the book*. (Note: The normal force and gravitational force on the book are *not* an action-reaction pair.)

## V. Applying the Third Law to Systems

When analyzing a system of multiple interacting objects, the internal action-reaction forces between objects within the system cancel out. This simplification is useful when applying [[Newton’s Second Law]] to the entire system as a whole, as only external forces need to be considered. For example, if two blocks are connected and pushed, the force of block 1 on block 2 and block 2 on block 1 are internal forces to the two-block system and sum to zero for the system's net acceleration.
