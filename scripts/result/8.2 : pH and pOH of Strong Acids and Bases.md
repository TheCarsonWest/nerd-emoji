# 8.2: pH and pOH of Strong Acids and Bases

## Strong Acids and Bases [[Strong Acids and Bases]]
*   Strong acids and bases completely dissociate in water. This means that for every mole of strong acid/base added to water, one mole of $H_3O^+$ or $OH^-$ ions are produced, respectively.
*   Examples of strong acids: HCl, HBr, HI, $HNO_3$, $H_2SO_4$, $HClO_4$.
*   Examples of strong bases: Group 1 hydroxides (LiOH, NaOH, KOH, RbOH, CsOH), Group 2 hydroxides ($Ca(OH)_2$, $Sr(OH)_2$, $Ba(OH)_2$).

## pH Calculations
*   pH is a measure of the acidity of a solution. It is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydronium ion concentration ($[H_3O^+]$).
$$pH = -log[H_3O^+]$$
*   For strong acids, the concentration of $H_3O^+$ is equal to the concentration of the strong acid, assuming complete dissociation.

    *   If you have 0.1 M of HCl, then $[H_3O^+]$ = 0.1 M.
    *   $pH = -log(0.1) = 1$.

## pOH Calculations
*   pOH is a measure of the basicity of a solution. It is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydroxide ion concentration ($[OH^-]$).
$$pOH = -log[OH^-]$$
*   For strong bases, the concentration of $OH^-$ is equal to the concentration of the strong base, taking into account the stoichiometry.

    *   If you have 0.05 M of NaOH, then $[OH^-]$ = 0.05 M.
    *   $pOH = -log(0.05) = 1.30$.
    *   If you have 0.05 M of $Ba(OH)_2$, then $[OH^-] = 2 \times 0.05M = 0.1 M$.
    *   $pOH = -log(0.1) = 1$.

## Relationship between pH and pOH
*   In aqueous solutions at $25^\circ C$, the sum of pH and pOH is always equal to 14.
$$pH + pOH = 14$$
*   This relationship is derived from the [[Ionic product of water Kw]] ($K_w$).
$$K_w = [H_3O^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}$$
$$pH + pOH = -log(K_w) = -log(1.0 \times 10^{-14}) = 14$$

## Calculating $[H_3O^+]$ and $[OH^-]$ from pH and pOH
*   To find the hydronium ion concentration from pH:
$$[H_3O^+] = 10^{-pH}$$
*   To find the hydroxide ion concentration from pOH:
$$[OH^-] = 10^{-pOH}$$

## Examples
1.  **Calculate the pH of a 0.020 M solution of $HNO_3$.**
    *   $HNO_3$ is a strong acid, so $[H_3O^+] = 0.020 M$.
    *   $pH = -log(0.020) = 1.70$.

2.  **Calculate the pOH of a 0.0050 M solution of $KOH$.**
    *   $KOH$ is a strong base, so $[OH^-] = 0.0050 M$.
    *   $pOH = -log(0.0050) = 2.30$.

3.  **Calculate the pH of a 0.0050 M solution of $KOH$.**
    *   $KOH$ is a strong base, so $[OH^-] = 0.0050 M$.
    *   $pOH = -log(0.0050) = 2.30$.
    *   $pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 2.30 = 11.70$.

4. **Calculate the pH of a 0.01 M solution of $Ca(OH)_2$.**
    *  $Ca(OH)_2$ is a strong base with two $OH^-$ groups, so $[OH^-]= 2 * 0.01 = 0.02 M$
    *  $pOH = -log(0.02)= 1.7$
    *  $pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.7 = 12.3$
