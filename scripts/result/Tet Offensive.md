## ID: [[Tet Offensive]] 
## When: January 30, 1968 - September 23, 1968 (Height of the attacks: January 30 - March 1968)

## Who:
* **North Vietnam:** Viet Cong (VC) and North Vietnamese Army (NVA) forces.
* **South Vietnam:** Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces.
* **United States:** U.S. Military forces under the command of General William Westmoreland

## What:
A series of surprise attacks by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces during the Tet holiday (Vietnamese New Year). The attacks targeted major cities, military bases, and government buildings throughout South Vietnam, including the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Turning Point in Public Opinion:** Despite being a military defeat for the communists (VC/NVA suffered heavy casualties), the [[Tet Offensive]] had a profound impact on American public opinion. It exposed the credibility gap between what the Johnson administration was saying about the war ("We are winning") and the reality on the ground.
* **Erosion of Support for the War:** The graphic images of the fighting and the scale of the offensive shocked the American public, leading to increased anti-war sentiment and protests. Support for the war plummeted.
* **Decline of LBJ's Presidency:** The [[Tet Offensive]] significantly weakened President Lyndon B. Johnson's political standing. He faced increasing criticism from both hawks and doves.
* **Shift in US Strategy:** The offensive led to a reevaluation of U.S. strategy in Vietnam. Johnson announced he would not seek reelection and began seeking a negotiated peace settlement.
* **Credibility Gap Widens:** Government's statements about the war's progress were seen as dishonest, leading to further distrust in the government.
* **Showed Resilience of the Enemy:** It demonstrated the Viet Cong's continued strength and capability, despite previous claims of their imminent defeat.
* **Ultimately Led to US Withdrawal:** The [[Tet Offensive]] was a major catalyst for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam. Although the US "won" the battle, it lost the "war" for public opinion.
