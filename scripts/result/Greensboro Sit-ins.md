## ID: [[Greensboro Sit-ins]] 
**WHEN:** February 1, 1960

**WHO:**

*   **Started by:** Four African American students: Franklin McCain, Ezell Blair Jr. (later Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, and Joseph McNeil, all students at [[North Carolina]] A&T, a historically Black college.
*   **Involved:** Other African American students, civil rights activists, local communities, and eventually, the management of Woolworth's stores.
*   **Inspired by:** The broader [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the nonviolent direct action tactics promoted by groups like the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE).

**WHAT:**

A series of nonviolent protests that began when four African American students sat down at a "whites-only" lunch counter at a Woolworth's store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and requested service. They were refused service but remained seated. The next day, more students joined them, and the sit-ins continued and spread to other cities across the South.

**IMPACT: Why Significant?:**

*   **Sparked a movement:** The Greensboro sit-ins ignited a wave of similar protests and sit-ins across the South, challenging segregation in public accommodations.
*   **Increased national awareness:** The sit-ins brought the issue of racial segregation to national attention and helped galvanize support for the Civil Rights Movement.
*   **Economic pressure:** The sit-ins led to economic pressure on businesses that practiced segregation, as customers (both Black and white) boycotted segregated establishments.
*   **Desegregation of lunch counters:** Many Woolworth's stores and other businesses in the South began to desegregate their lunch counters due to the sit-ins and the resulting economic pressure.
*   **Empowerment of students:** The sit-ins demonstrated the power of student activism and grassroots organizing in the fight for civil rights.
*   **Momentum for the Civil Rights Act:** The Greensboro sit-ins helped build momentum for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
