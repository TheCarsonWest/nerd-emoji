# Representing a Categorical Variable with Tables

When analyzing data, the first step is often to organize and display it. For [[Categorical Variable|categorical variables]], tables are a fundamental tool to summarize the distribution of data. A categorical variable assigns labels that place individuals into particular groups or categories.

## Frequency Tables

A **frequency table** (also known as a **one-way table**) displays the counts of observations for each category of a single categorical variable. It shows how often each category occurs in a dataset.

### Components of a Frequency Table:
*   **Categories**: The distinct groups or labels of the categorical variable.
*   **Frequency (Count)**: The number of individuals falling into each category.
*   **Relative Frequency (Proportion)**: The proportion of individuals in each category. This is calculated as:
    $$
    \text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Frequency of Category}}{\text{Total Number of Observations}}
    $$
*   **Percent Frequency (Percentage)**: The relative frequency expressed as a percentage.
    $$
    \text{Percent Frequency} = \text{Relative Frequency} \times 100\%
    $$

### Example: Preferred Pet Type

Suppose a survey of 50 students asked about their preferred pet type.

| Pet Type | Frequency (Count) | Relative Frequency | Percent Frequency |
| :------- | :---------------- | :----------------- | :---------------- |
| Dog      | 22                | $22/50 = 0.44$     | $44\%$            |
| Cat      | 15                | $15/50 = 0.30$     | $30\%$            |
| Fish     | 8                 | $8/50 = 0.16$      | $16\%$            |
| Bird     | 5                 | $5/50 = 0.10$      | $10\%$            |
| **Total**| **50**            | **1.00**           | **100%**          |

This table clearly shows the distribution of preferred pet types among the surveyed students. For instance, dogs are the most preferred pet, accounting for $44\%$ of the responses.

## Interpreting Tables

When interpreting a frequency table, look for:
*   **Highest/Lowest Frequencies**: Which categories have the most or fewest observations?
*   **Dominant Categories**: Are there categories that clearly stand out as more common than others?
*   **Proportions**: What percentage of the data falls into a specific category?

Tables provide a precise summary of the data. While tables are excellent for numerical precision, [[Representing a Categorical Variable with Graphs]] such as bar charts and pie charts offer a more visual representation of the distribution, making patterns easier to spot quickly.

## Two-Way Tables

When you have two categorical variables, you can use a [[Two-Way Table|two-way table]] (also known as a contingency table) to display the relationship between them. This allows for a deeper analysis of how categories of one variable relate to categories of another. For more on this, refer to [[Representing Two Categorical Variables]].

Understanding how to construct and interpret frequency tables is a foundational skill in statistics, enabling clear and concise communication of categorical data distributions.
