## ID: Paris Peace Accords (Vietnam War)

**WHEN:** January 27, 1973

**WHO:**
*   **Signatories:** [[United States]] (represented by Henry Kissinger), North Vietnam (represented by Le Duc Tho), South Vietnam (represented by Nguyen Van Thieu), Viet Cong (represented by Madame Nguyen Thi Binh)
*   **Key Negotiators:** Henry Kissinger (US National Security Advisor and later Secretary of State), Le Duc Tho (North Vietnamese Politburo member)

**WHAT:**

A peace treaty signed in Paris, France, that officially ended direct U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War. Key provisions included:

*   Ceasefire throughout Vietnam
*   Withdrawal of all U.S. troops and military personnel within 60 days
*   Release of all American prisoners of war (POWs)
*   Agreement on the principle of self-determination for the South Vietnamese people and the eventual reunification of Vietnam through peaceful means.
*   Allowed North Vietnamese troops to remain in South Vietnam.

**IMPACT: Why Significant?**

*   **End of U.S. Involvement:** Marked the end of U.S. military participation in the Vietnam War, a highly divisive and costly conflict for the United States.
*   **"Peace with Honor":** The Nixon administration touted the accords as achieving "peace with honor", though the long-term stability of South Vietnam remained uncertain.
*   **Fall of Saigon:** The accords were ultimately a failure. Within two years of the U.S. withdrawal, North Vietnam violated the ceasefire agreement and launched a full-scale invasion of South Vietnam, leading to the fall of Saigon in April 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.
*   **Weakened U.S. Credibility:** The collapse of South Vietnam after the U.S. withdrawal damaged American credibility on the world stage and led to questions about the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy.
*   **War Powers Resolution:** The [[Vietnam War]] and the perceived abuse of presidential power during the conflict contributed to the passage of the War Powers Resolution in 1973, which aimed to limit the president's ability to commit U.S. troops to military action without congressional approval.
