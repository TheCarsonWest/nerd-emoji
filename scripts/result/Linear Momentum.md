## Introduction to Linear Momentum

Linear momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the "quantity of motion" an object possesses. It's a measure of how difficult it is to stop an object and depends on both its mass and its velocity. Understanding linear momentum is crucial for analyzing collisions and other interactions where forces act over short durations.

## Definition and Formula

Linear momentum, denoted by $\vec{p}$, is defined as the product of an object's mass ($m$) and its velocity ($\vec{v}$).

$
\vec{p} = m\vec{v}
$

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Vector Quantity**: Momentum is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. Its direction is always the same as the object's velocity. This aligns with our understanding of [[Scalars and Vectors in One Dimension]] and [[Vectors and Motion in Two Dimensions]].
*   **Mass ($m$)**: A scalar quantity, typically measured in kilograms (kg).
*   **Velocity ($\vec{v}$)**: A vector quantity, measured in meters per second (m/s).

## Units of Momentum

The SI unit for linear momentum is the kilogram-meter per second (kg·m/s). There is no special name for this unit.

## Relationship to Newton's Second Law

Linear momentum is directly linked to [[Newton’s Second Law]]. While Newton's Second Law is often stated as $F = ma$, its more fundamental form involves the rate of change of momentum.

The net external force ($\vec{F}_{\text{net}}$) acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of its linear momentum:

$
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}
$

For a constant mass system, we can derive $F=ma$:
$
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{d(m\vec{v})}{dt} = m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = m\vec{a}
$
This demonstrates that a net force causes a change in momentum, not just acceleration.

## Importance in Physics

Linear momentum is particularly useful when analyzing systems where forces are not constant or are difficult to measure directly, especially in situations like collisions or explosions. Its importance is further highlighted by the principle of [[Conservation of Linear Momentum]], which states that the total momentum of an isolated system remains constant.

## Types of Momentum

| Type                | Description                                                          |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linear Momentum** | Momentum of an object moving along a straight line or path.          |
| **Angular Momentum**| [[Angular Momentum and Angular Impulse]] - Momentum of a rotating object, topic 4.4. |

## Example Scenarios

Consider a 2 kg object moving at 3 m/s to the right.
Its linear momentum is:
$
\vec{p} = (2 \text{ kg})(3 \text{ m/s, right}) = 6 \text{ kg·m/s, right}
$

If the same object was moving at 3 m/s to the left, its momentum would be $6 \text{ kg·m/s, left}$. This emphasizes the vector nature of momentum.

## Connection to Other Topics

Understanding linear momentum is essential for advanced topics such as:

*   [[Conservation of Linear Momentum]]
*   [[Elastic and Inelastic Collisions]]
*   Rocket propulsion (where mass changes over time)
