## ID: The "Lilliputians" Metaphor in Gilded Age Analysis

## When: 1870s-1900 (Gilded Age)

## Who:
* **Referred to:**  The working class, particularly immigrants and urban poor.
* **Used by:**  Writers, journalists, and social commentators critiquing the vast disparity of wealth and power during the Gilded Age.  This wasn't a formal group; it was a literary trope.

## What:
The term "Lilliputians," referencing Jonathan Swift's *Gulliver's Travels*, was used to describe the seemingly insignificant size and power of the working class in comparison to the immense wealth and influence of industrialists and the wealthy elite during the Gilded Age.  The metaphor highlighted the vast social and economic chasm between the opulent lifestyles of the wealthy and the struggles of the impoverished masses.  It emphasizes the feeling of being overwhelmed and controlled by powerful forces beyond one's reach.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Social Commentary:** The metaphor served as a powerful critique of the social and economic inequalities inherent in Gilded Age America.
* **Literary Device:** It became a recurring motif in literature and journalism of the era, capturing the public sentiment about the growing disparity between the rich and the poor.
* **Historical Context:**  It underscores the lack of political and economic power held by the working class despite their crucial role in driving industrial growth.  This contributed to the rise of labor movements and social reform efforts.
* **Contrast to Titans:**  The "Lilliputians" are directly contrasted with the "Titans" of industry (like Carnegie, Rockefeller, etc.), highlighting the unequal power dynamic.
