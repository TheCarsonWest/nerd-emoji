* **Suburbanization:** Contributed to the growth of suburbs as families sought larger homes outside of cities.
* **Social and Cultural Changes:** Baby Boomers influenced societal norms, values, and cultural trends as they came of age, impacting education, music, fashion, and social activism (e.g., the counterculture movement of the 1960s).
