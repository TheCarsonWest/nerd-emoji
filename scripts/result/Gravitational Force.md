## Introduction to Gravitational Force

[[Gravitational Force]] is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, responsible for the attraction between any two objects with mass. It's a fundamental concept in physics, explaining everything from why an apple falls from a tree to the orbits of planets around the Sun. Unlike electric or magnetic forces, gravity is always attractive.

## Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

Sir Isaac Newton formulated the Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

### The Equation

The magnitude of the gravitational force ($F_g$) between two objects with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, separated by a distance $r$, is given by:

$
F_g = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$

Where:
*   $F_g$ is the magnitude of the gravitational force (in Newtons, N).
*   $G$ is the **Universal Gravitational Constant**.
*   $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects (in kilograms, kg).
*   $r$ is the distance between the centers of the two masses (in meters, m).

### Universal Gravitational Constant ($G$)

The universal gravitational constant $G$ is an empirically determined value that quantifies the strength of the gravitational force.

*   **Value**: $G \approx 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2$
*   **Significance**: This extremely small value indicates that gravitational force is very weak unless at least one of the masses involved is very large (like a planet or star).

### Inverse Square Law

The $1/r^2$ term in the equation signifies an **inverse square law**. This means that if the distance $r$ between the two objects doubles, the gravitational force between them decreases by a factor of four ($2^2$). Conversely, if the distance is halved, the force increases by a factor of four.

### Vector Nature of Gravitational Force

[[Forces and Free-Body Diagrams]] are vector quantities, meaning they have both magnitude and direction. The gravitational force acts along the line connecting the centers of the two masses. For $m_1$ attracting $m_2$, the force $F_{12}$ on $m_2$ due to $m_1$ points towards $m_1$. By [[Newtonâ€™s Third Law]], the force $F_{21}$ on $m_1$ due to $m_2$ is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to $F_{12}$.

## Gravitational Field and Acceleration Due to Gravity ($g$)

A **gravitational field** is a region of space around a mass in which another mass would experience a gravitational force. It's a useful concept for understanding how gravity acts without direct contact.

### Gravitational Field Strength

The gravitational field strength ($g$) at a point is defined as the gravitational force per unit mass at that point.

$
g = \frac{F_g}{m}
$

For an object of mass $m$ experiencing a force $F_g$ due to a larger mass $M$ (e.g., Earth), we can substitute Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:

$
g = \frac{\frac{G M m}{r^2}}{m} = \frac{G M}{r^2}
$

*   Where $M$ is the mass of the larger object (e.g., Earth), and $r$ is the distance from the center of $M$ to the point where $g$ is being measured.
*   The units of $g$ are N/kg, which is equivalent to m/s$^2$ (acceleration units).

### Acceleration Due to Gravity Near Earth's Surface

On the surface of the Earth, the value of $g$ is approximately $9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$. This is the acceleration experienced by an object in free fall near the Earth's surface, assuming air resistance is negligible.

| Location           | Distance from Earth's center ($r$) | Gravitational Acceleration ($g$) |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| Earth's Surface    | $R_E$ (Earth's radius)             | $\approx 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$      |
| $1 \times R_E$ above surface | $2 R_E$                            | $\approx 2.45 \text{ m/s}^2$     |
| $2 \times R_E$ above surface | $3 R_E$                            | $\approx 1.09 \text{ m/s}^2$     |

As the distance $r$ from the center of the Earth increases, the value of $g$ decreases proportionally to $1/r^2$. This is why astronauts in orbit still experience gravity, though it is weaker than on Earth's surface. They are "weightless" due to being in a constant state of free fall around the Earth, not because there's no gravity.
