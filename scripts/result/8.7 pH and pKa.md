# pH and pKa

## pH Scale

*   pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution.
*   $$pH = -log[H_3O^+]$$
*   pOH is a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) in an aqueous solution.
*   $$pOH = -log[OH^-]$$
*   [[Water Autoionization]]: $K_w = [H_3O^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}$ at 25°C
*   [[pH and pOH]]: $pH + pOH = 14$ at 25°C
*   pH < 7: acidic solution
*   pH = 7: neutral solution
*   pH > 7: basic solution

## pKa and Acid Strength

*   pKa is a measure of the acidity of a specific molecule or acid. It's the negative base-10 logarithm of the [[Acid Dissociation Constant]] ($K_a$).
*   $$pK_a = -log(K_a)$$
*   A smaller pKa indicates a stronger acid (larger $K_a$).
*   A larger pKa indicates a weaker acid (smaller $K_a$).
*   $K_a = 10^{-pK_a}$
*   [[Acid Strength and Conjugate Base Strength]]: Stronger acids have weaker conjugate bases, and weaker acids have stronger conjugate bases.

## Relationship between pKa, pH, and Buffer Solutions

*   [[Buffer Solutions]]: A solution that resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added.
*   A buffer solution is most effective when the concentrations of the weak acid and its conjugate base are approximately equal (ideally within a factor of 10).
*   [[Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation]]: Relates the pH of a solution, the pKa of the acid, and the ratio of the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base.
    $$pH = pK_a + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$$
    where:
    *   $[A^-]$ is the concentration of the conjugate base
    *   $[HA]$ is the concentration of the weak acid

## Titration and pKa

*   [[Titration]]: A technique used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution by reacting it with a solution of known concentration.
*   The midpoint of a titration curve (where half of the acid has been neutralized) corresponds to the pKa of the weak acid. At this point, $[HA] = [A^-]$, so $pH = pK_a$.
*   [[Acid-Base Indicators]]: Substances that change color depending on the pH of the solution. The color change occurs within a specific pH range, which is related to the pKa of the indicator.

## Polyprotic Acids and pKa Values

*   [[Polyprotic Acids]]: Acids that can donate more than one proton ($H^+$) per molecule.
*   Each proton has its own dissociation constant ($K_{a1}, K_{a2}, K_{a3}$, etc.) and corresponding pKa value ($pK_{a1}, pK_{a2}, pK_{a3}$, etc.).
*   $K_{a1} > K_{a2} > K_{a3}$ and $pK_{a1} < pK_{a2} < pK_{a3}$: It is always easier to remove the first proton than subsequent protons.
*   When solving problems with polyprotic acids, it is often acceptable to ignore the second and subsequent dissociations if the $K_{a}$ values differ by several orders of magnitude, because the contribution of $H^+$ from subsequent dissociations is negligible.
