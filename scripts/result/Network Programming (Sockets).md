## Network Programming (Sockets)

### Overview
Network programming in Python allows the development of applications that can communicate over a network. It involves creating sockets, which are endpoints that enable communication between two or more devices.

### How to Use Sockets
Creating a socket involves the following steps:

- **Create a socket:** Use the `socket` module to create a socket object. This takes parameters such as `family` (IPv4 or IPv6) and `type` (TCP or UDP).
- **Bind the socket:** Bind the socket to a specific network interface and port using the `bind` method.
- **Listen for connections:** For server applications, use the `listen` method to start listening for incoming connections.
- **Accept connections:** For server applications, use the `accept` method to accept an incoming connection, returning a new socket for communication.
- **Send and receive data:** Use the `send` and `recv` methods on the socket objects to send and receive data.

### Code Examples
**Server Example:**
```python
import socket

# create a socket object
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# bind the socket to a network interface and port
server_socket.bind(('localhost', 8000))

# start listening for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(5)

# accept an incoming connection
client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()

# send data to the client
client_socket.send(b'Hello from the server')

# receive data from the client
data = client_socket.recv(1024)

# close the socket
client_socket.close()
server_socket.close()
```

**Client Example:**
```python
import socket

# create a socket object
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# connect to the server
client_socket.connect(('localhost', 8000))

# send data to the server
client_socket.send(b'Hello from the client')

# receive data from the server
data = client_socket.recv(1024)

# close the socket
client_socket.close()
```

### Related Python Concepts

- [[File IO Modes]]: Sockets operate similarly to files in terms of reading and writing data.
- [[Exception Handling]]: Socket operations can encounter errors, which can be handled using try/except blocks.
- [[Concurrency and Multithreading]]: Socket programming often involves dealing with multiple connections in parallel, which requires understanding concurrency.
- [[Multiprocessing]]: Socket programming can also benefit from multiprocessing for better resource utilization.
- [[Asynchronous Programming]]: Sockets can be used for asynchronous communication using libraries like asyncio.
