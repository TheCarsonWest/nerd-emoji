## Private and Protected Members

### Explanation
Private and protected members in Python are used to restrict access to certain attributes or methods of a class. Private members are only accessible within the class, while protected members can be accessed from within the class and its subclasses.

### Usage
**Private Members**

To make a member private, prefix it with two leading underscores (_). For example:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __private_method(self):
        ...
    
    def __private_attribute = ...
```

**Protected Members**

To make a member protected, prefix it with a single leading underscore (_). For example:

```python
class MyClass:
    def _protected_method(self):
        ...
    
    _protected_attribute = ...
```

### Code Examples
```python
# Private method
class MyClass:
    def __private_method(self):
        print("This is a private method")

# Protected method
class MyClass:
    def _protected_method(self):
        print("This is a protected method")
```
