Create a notecard on the APUSH "Unit 8: Post WWII-1970s" topic {file_name}, using this following format:
WHEN: (exact date if possible, if not narrow it down to a specific time period...acts/laws, specific events, etc should have specific dates. AP exam questions are ALWAYS broken down into certain time frames; timelines will be very important)

WHO: (who is involved or who started the event or concept; if a person - who is the person, President, Doctor, lawyer, etc. that would be important to know) 

WHAT: (answer what the concept is or what the person did exactly or what happened specifically during an event 

IMPACT:Why is that significant? What did it lead to? What impact did the person or event or law have on the United States?

Here is a good example

## ID: Battle of Gettysburg

## When: July 1-3, 1863

## Who: 
* **Union:**  General George Meade and the Army of the Potomac
* **Confederate:** General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern [[Virginia]]

## What: 

A pivotal battle of the American Civil War fought in Gettysburg, [[Pennsylvania]]. It involved three days of intense fighting between Union and Confederate forces. The battle culminated in a decisive Union victory, marking a turning point in the war.

## Impact: Why Significant?: 
* **Turning Point:**  The Battle of Gettysburg marked the beginning of the end for the Confederacy. It crippled Lee's army and forced him to retreat back to [[Virginia]].
* **Union Momentum:** The victory boosted Union morale and strengthened the resolve to continue the war.
* **Increased Casualties:** Both sides suffered significant casualties, highlighting the immense human cost of the war.
* **Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]]:** Delivered on November 19, 1863, Lincoln's famous speech redefined the purpose of the war as a fight for freedom and equality, solidifying the importance of the Union victory.
* **Strategic Significance:** Gettysburg stopped Lee's invasion of the North, preventing a major victory for the Confederates and ultimately leading to the Union's success.

Make a AP Chemistry note page on ({name}) in markdown format:
- make use of headings
- use the LaTeX equation library format when writing equations.($$Two dollar signs for a block equation$$, $One dollar sign for an inline equation$
- For any topic that you believe needs its own independent explanation, enclose it in TWO brackets([[like this]]). The notes page for that will be generated solely off of its title, so make sure its specific enough.
- There are already many other notes pages that you can reference by doing the [[double brackets]]. Enclosing them in double brackets like this will create a link to the page with that title for the user. Here is a list of all of the other topic that have already been written about
