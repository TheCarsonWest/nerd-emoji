## A Journey Through the Shadows of West Africa's Slave Trade: A Personal Reflection

My great-great-grandmother was one of the eleven million Africans forcibly transported to the New World. This journey to West Africa, to the very shores where that horrific trade flourished, is a deeply personal quest to understand my heritage and confront the complexities of its past.

My exploration began in El Mina, the first European slave trading post in sub-Saharan Africa.  The Mediterranean influence is palpable, a stark reminder of the Portuguese and Spanish presence that initiated this brutal chapter in history. El Mina, once a thriving market town, exploded in size fueled by the unimaginable commodity: human beings.  The Portuguese, initially seeking gold, discovered something far more lucrative—a readily available supply of enslaved people provided by powerful African kingdoms.

From El Mina, I journeyed inland to Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti Empire.  While the empire’s vast size and military prowess are undeniable, its role in the slave trade cannot be ignored. The Ashanti sold prisoners of war and criminals, amassing significant wealth and power through this horrific commerce.  A conversation with the king’s son revealed a nuanced perspective: regret for the loss of human resources and potential, but also an acceptance of the era's realities, a fatalistic view that things couldn't have been otherwise.  This explanation, however palatable, doesn't diminish the brutal reality of their participation in the slave trade driven by profit.

My journey continued east to the kingdom of Dahomey, a realm notorious for its human sacrifice and powerful Amazonian warriors.  The palaces at Abomey, once the center of a vast empire, stand as testaments to both the kingdom’s power and its complicity in the slave trade.  Conversations with locals revealed a reluctance to dwell on this dark chapter, a testament to the passage of time and the complexities of national memory.  However, the sheer scale of the Dahomey’s involvement, exporting nearly a million slaves from Abomey alone, remains undeniable.  The impact resonates profoundly in the present.

My final destination was Ouidah, a notorious slave port.  The streets themselves seem haunted, the lingering echoes of the trade palpable.  The encounter with a descendant of Don Francisco de Souza, a Brazilian slave trader who held significant power in Ouidah, provided a jarring perspective.  While the family presents a narrative of their ancestor saving lives by sending enslaved people to the New World instead of facing sacrifice, the inherent contradiction and the devastating impact on the descendants are undeniable.  The family’s mixed feelings regarding their ancestor highlight the enduring complexities and moral ambiguity of this historical period.

The slave castles, like Elmina’s “Door of No Return,” are more than just historical sites; they represent the ultimate dehumanization of millions.  The guided tours, while often focusing on European culpability, increasingly acknowledge the active role of African kings and traders in the system. This active participation, often driven by profit, is a difficult truth to confront, shattering idealized narratives of passive victimhood.

My journey concluded at Ouidah’s slave road, a stark reminder of the final march to the ships.  The broken pottery and glass remnants of the trading market, juxtaposed against the poignant “Gate of No Return,” encapsulates the brutality and enduring legacy of the transatlantic slave trade.  The immense suffering inflicted on millions is evident, a legacy felt even today by those directly descended from the traders, highlighting the deep and complex scars that this chapter in history has left.  While African kingdoms built impressive empires, their complicity in the slave trade represents a dark and agonizing truth that requires honest reflection.  The legacy of this history is far from simple, a reflection of the multifaceted nature of human history itself.
