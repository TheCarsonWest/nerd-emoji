## The Myth of Greatness: Re-examining Alexander the Great through the Lens of Celebrity Culture

John Green's Crash Course World History episode on Alexander the Great cleverly juxtaposes the ancient Macedonian king with modern-day celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino to dissect the very notion of "greatness."  Green argues that the historical designation of "great," often bestowed upon men, is subjective and problematic, highlighting the inherent biases in historical narratives.  He challenges the traditional view of history as merely the chronicle of "great men's deeds," proposing three alternative perspectives on Alexander's greatness: his accomplishments, his lasting impact, and the construction of his legend.

**Accomplishments: Conquest and its Limitations**

Alexander's military prowess is undeniable. He expanded his father Philip II's empire, conquering Persia and reaching the Indus River. His tactical brilliance, possibly aided by superior technology (sarissas), led to an undefeated record. However, Green points out Alexander's shortcomings in empire-building.  His focus on conquest overshadowed the creation of lasting institutions, leading to the swift fragmentation of his empire into the Hellenistic kingdoms (Antigonids, Ptolemies, Seleucids) after his death. This highlights the difference between military conquest and effective governance.

**Impact: A Legacy Forged in Death**

Alexander's influence extended far beyond his lifespan. His legacy shaped military strategies for centuries, influencing figures like Napoleon and Pompey the Great.  He introduced the concept of absolute monarchy to the Greco-Roman world.  The cities he founded, many bearing his name or that of his horse Bucephalus (e.g., Alexandria), became centers of learning and trade.  His promotion of the Greek language facilitated communication and commerce across a vast territory, ultimately impacting even the writing of the New Testament in Greek. Green uses the analogy of the "Situation" indirectly causing a marriage to illustrate how influence doesn't necessarily equate to direct responsibility for subsequent events.

**Legend: The Power of Mythmaking**

Alexander's short life (he died at 32) contributed to the embellishment of his story.  Accounts written long after his death embellished his accomplishments and created a heroic narrative. Stories of miraculous events, such as rain falling in the desert to aid his army, and tales of his fierce and possibly murderous wife Roxana, added to his legendary status. Even the circumstances of his death—possibly from a fever, alcohol poisoning, or assassination—were debated, reflecting the desire to maintain a heroic image.  The episode posits that Alexander's greatness wasn't solely intrinsic but rather a constructed narrative, shaped by those who came after him and chose to admire and emulate him.

**Celebrity Culture and the Pursuit of Greatness**

By comparing Alexander to contemporary celebrities, Green explores the underlying human desire for legacy and remembrance.  He suggests that the pursuit of fame, exemplified by figures like Kardashian and Sorrentino, is fundamentally driven by this same yearning for lasting impact. However, he critiques the modern obsession with celebrity culture, contrasting the violence and conquest that built Alexander's legend with arguably less consequential modern forms of fame.  Green concludes that "we decide what to worship and what to care about," emphasizing the active role we play in constructing historical narratives and shaping our cultural values.  He advocates for a more nuanced and inclusive approach to history, acknowledging the contributions of women and challenging the traditional focus on celebrated individuals.  The episode ultimately serves as a call for critical engagement with historical narratives and a reassessment of what truly constitutes "greatness."
