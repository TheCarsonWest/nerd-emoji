This transcript is about the surprising popularity of KFC in Japan during Christmas. It doesn't contain any information about a young author, childhood stories, cultural background differences, or a college roommate. Therefore, I cannot answer the first three questions.


Regarding the chart on ethnocentrism and cultural relativism, it's difficult to find clear examples in this specific transcript. The video primarily focuses on a marketing campaign and its success, not on judging or comparing cultures. However, we can identify some potential nuances related to cultural relativism:


**Potential Cultural Relativism:**

* **Acceptance of a foreign tradition:** The Japanese adoption of a Western, specifically American, fast-food chain's promotional campaign for a Christian holiday, even though Christianity is not widely practiced in Japan, could be viewed through the lens of cultural relativism. It demonstrates an openness to integrating foreign customs and adapting them to the local context.  The campaign wasn't forced upon Japan, but rather adopted and adapted organically within Japanese culture.
* **Understanding the context of KFC's success:** The video explains the historical and economic factors that contributed to KFC's rise in Japan, including post-war agricultural developments and Mitsubishi's involvement. This nuanced perspective avoids simply labeling the phenomenon as strange or unusual, instead seeking to understand it within its specific cultural and historical context.


**Potential (lack of) Ethnocentrism:**  The video largely avoids an ethnocentric perspective. It doesn't judge the Japanese embrace of KFC at Christmas as "weird" or inferior to other traditions. Instead, it presents it as a unique cultural phenomenon with its own history and internal logic.  
It's important to remember that identifying these concepts requires interpretation and context.  The video is primarily descriptive rather than analytical, making it challenging to pinpoint clear-cut examples.
