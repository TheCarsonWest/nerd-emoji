**The Samurai: Beyond the Myth of Honor and Warfare**

For centuries, the image of the samurai has been romanticized: paragons of virtue, masters of warfare, and beacons of integrity. However, this perception is often far removed from the complex reality of the samurai's evolution and their place within Japanese society. A new video seeks to correct these misconceptions and explore the fascinating roles and perceptions of the samurai from their earliest days to the modern era.

**Origins and Early Development:**

The genesis of the samurai is intertwined with Japan's unique geographical position as an archipelago off the Korean Peninsula. The video highlights the profound influence of China on Japan, despite the geographical divide. The Japanese Emperor's position itself may have been adopted from China. During the early Heian period, the proto-Japanese state expanded northwards, initially employing an army based on the Chinese heavy infantry model of the Tang Dynasty.

However, they encountered the Emishi people of northeastern Honshu, a distinct group adept at horse archery tactics similar to those of the Huns and Mongols. The early Japanese struggled against these irregular guerrilla tactics, eventually adopting them into their own military strategies. The Emishi's resilience profoundly impacted the formation of the first samurai.

As the Heian Japanese began to subjugate the Emishi, families within this group established semi-autonomous feudal domains. These individuals became the first samurai, a term initially used by warriors in the Heian capital to distinguish themselves from the "unsophisticated louts" in the provinces. It's critical to understand that the earliest proto-samurai were likely Emishi horse archers, favored by the Emperor to suppress internal unrest.

**Rise to Power and the Shogunate:**

As the Heian period progressed, the central government in Kyoto became increasingly disinterested in governance, allowing the samurai to gain independence and power. Eventually, a series of revolts led to the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate, the first Shogunate in Japanese history. The Shogun, technically a high-ranking samurai ruling in the Emperor's name, was in reality a military dictator. However, the Shogun could even be a puppet ruler and the real power rested in the hands of powerful feudal landowners, the daimyo.

The Kamakura era faced a significant threat: the Yuan Empire under Kublai Khan launched two invasions of Japan. In both instances, the samurai used unconventional tactics, such as driving boats full of burning pitch into Mongol ships and launching suicide attacks. Two hurricanes ultimately destroyed the Mongol fleets, saving Japan. Despite their victory, the wars weakened the Kamakura Shogunate, leading to its downfall.

Following political maneuvering and an attempted imperial restoration, the Ashikaga Shogunate rose to power in 1338. Never as strong as its predecessor, the Ashikaga gradually lost control over local daimyo. The video notes that when a samurai feud began in Kyoto between the Hosokawa and Yamana clans in 1467, the Shogunate effectively lost all control over the provinces.

**Sengoku Jidai: The Golden Age of Samurai Warfare:**

The ensuing Sengoku Jidai, marked by the Onin War, saw Japan fragmented into hundreds of separate feudal domains ruled by daimyo. This era became the source of many myths and legends surrounding the samurai, events that likely occurred only in specific places and times. This was the Golden Age of samurai warfare and one of the periods that later samurai would look back on romanticize and attempt to emulate. While honor was common, so was deceit.

The video cites a rivalry between warlords Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen as an example of the former. Unlike many cutthroat conflicts, their rivalry resembled an annual competition between sophisticated gentlemen, and the two would meet in the same place every year to battle one another and then go back home. As the 16th century advanced, such gentlemanly conduct became less prevalent.

**Adapting to Firearms and Betrayal:**

European traders introduced firearms like the arquebus to Japan, changing the battlefield dramatically. Contrary to the myth that samurai rejected firearms as dishonorable, many daimyo who could afford them adopted the new technology and achieved success. Takeda Shingen purchased 300 firearms before his battle against Uesugi Kenshin in 1571.

Similarly, the video challenges the perception of samurai as paragons of truthfulness and honesty. When Oda Nobunaga was on his way to conquering japan and possibly unifying it, he was betrayed by a seemingly loyal general, Akechi Mitsuhide, who claimed the title of Shogun for himself. Mitsuhide claimed the title of Shogun for himself. Nobunaga was trapped and committed suicide, and Mitsuhide was killed a few months later when Oda's allies returned to deal with the traitor.

**The Tokugawa Shogunate and Decline:**

In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu won the Battle of Sekigahara and unified Japan under the Tokugawa Shogunate. This brought an end to warfare and left the samurai class with little to occupy their time. They became a hereditary class and transitioned into roles such as clerks, night watchmen, tax collectors, security guards, courtiers, and administrators.

The Bushido code of the samurai was gradually modified to include etiquette and politeness, aligning with their bureaucratic occupations. While martial training continued, it became more of an art form than preparation for real battle. Practical battle training and weaponry were sidelined in favor of styles such as kendo.

**The Fall of the Samurai:**

Agriculture became less important, causing the samurai's stipends to stagnate and decrease. This led to animosity between samurai and the rising merchant class. Masterless samurai, known as Ronin, increasingly became skilled bandits to make money. Eventually, under pressure from outside powers, the Tokugawa Shogunate was replaced by the Japanese Empire, and the samurai were sidelined.

**Legacy and Misconceptions:**

The samurai evolved, fueling further misconceptions and romanticism. The new Japanese nation warped Bushido into a philosophy used to signify a good citizen. The intensity that these new values created in the new nation of Japan burned white-hot until the Second World War and the nuclear attacks at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

After the subsequent surrender, Bushido was reconsidered and became more of a historical monument. The Japanese are still seen as a dedicated people when it comes to business and industry even in the modern day. The legacy of the samurai is clear and present in the land of the Rising Sun.
