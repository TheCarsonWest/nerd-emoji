**Summary:**

Federalist 70, written by Alexander Hamilton, argues for the importance of an independent judiciary in the new American government.

**Central Points:**

* **Judicial Independence:** Judges must be independent of the executive and legislative branches to ensure impartial decision-making.
* **Stability and Continuity:** A judiciary with life tenure and protection from removal would provide stability and continuity to the law.
* **Protection of Individual Rights:** An independent judiciary would protect individual rights from encroachment by the government.
* **Check on Majority Rule:** The judiciary would serve as a check on the tyranny of the majority by preventing the government from violating constitutional limits.

**Achievement:**

Federalist 70 helped to shape the structure of the American judiciary, establishing the principle of judicial independence and life tenure for federal judges. This framework has played a vital role in preserving the separation of powers and protecting the rights of citizens.
