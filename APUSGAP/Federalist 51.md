# [[Foundational Documents]]

Federalist 51 explores the concept of checks and balances in the proposed US Constitution. James Madison argues that no single branch of government should have absolute power and that each branch should have the ability to limit the others.

**Central Points:**

* **Separation of Powers:** The Constitution divides power among three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial.
* **Checks and Balances:** Each branch has the ability to check the powers of the other two.
* **Ambition:** Ambition is a natural human trait that can lead to the abuse of power. Checks and balances help to restrain ambition and prevent tyranny.
* **Factionalism:** Factions are groups of people with common interests who may seek to dominate others. Checks and balances protect against the tyranny of the majority and minority.
* **Extended Republic:** The Constitution creates an extended republic, which makes it more difficult for factions to form and control the government.

**Achievement:**

Federalist 51 was a key argument in favor of the ratification of the [[The Constitution]]. It helped to convince skeptics that the new government would not be a tyranny but rather a system of balanced powers that would protect the rights of individuals. The principles of checks and balances enshrined in Federalist 51 were written into Articles [[article i|One]], [[Article II|Two]], and [[article iii|Three]].
