By June 2025 there will be a [full obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/), (and now a web viewer! for):
- AP US History (Yes)
- AP Chemistry (Yes)
- AP Calculus AB (Not really)
- AP Human Geography (Yes)
- AP English Language and Composition (Not Really)
- Arabic 2(Kinda)


- Theres also a lot of python scripts that can do various things with Google Gemini models or just formatting things useful for making these notes
	- yt2gpt.py: makes notes off of video transcripts
	- voiceAi.py: lets you talk to your microphone to make notes
		- (wip as of 10/22/24)
	- filemaker.py: makes a bunch of .md files with a set prompt and a title(useful for making APUSH flashcards)
		- prompts.py: where all the various prompts ive used for filemaker.py are stored
	- append.py: appends a string to all .md files in a folder and subfolders
	- prepend.py: the same as above but prepending
	- linker.py: is supposed to add double brackets(how you link things in obsidian)
		- brackets.py: probably doesnt work idk, supposed to help fix the mistakes linker.py leaves behind
	- replace.py: replaces all of one string with another in a specific file folder and subfolders
