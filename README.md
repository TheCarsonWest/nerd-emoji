# My 24-25 Notes

# Start at [[nexus]] if you are on web viewer or obsidian
# Go to [here](https://thecarsonwest.github.io/test/public/nexus/) to see the web viewer

## anyone can use these idc
By June 2025 there will be a [full obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/), and now a web viewer! for:
- AP US History
- AP Chemistry
- AP Calculus AB
- AP Human Geography
- AP English Language and Composition

By the looks of things it might just be APUSH, APHG, and AP Chem


Once I'm done with the year I'll post the grades I got on everything(and AP Test Sores once those come out)
