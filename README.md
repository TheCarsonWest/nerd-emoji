By June 2025 there will be a [full obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/), (and now a web viewer) for:
- AP US History (Yes)
	- Flashcards on all the events they can reference on the AP Test
		- Doesn't include all the history they can use
	- Rundowns on various important people and places with a really good AI Prompt
- AP Chemistry (Yes)
	- Whatever topics we cover in class
- AP Calculus AB (Not really)
	- Bro doesnt let me use my macbook in class
- AP Human Geography (Yes)
	- Whatever we cover in class
- AP English Language and Composition (Not Really)
	- Some speeches and debates copy pasted so i have quick access to them myself
- Arabic 2(Kinda)
	- Only when I feel like it


- Theres also a lot of python scripts that can do various things with Google Gemini models or just formatting things useful for making these notes
	- yt2gpt.py: makes notes off of video transcripts
	- voiceAi.py: lets you talk to your microphone to make notes
		- (wip as of 10/22/24)
		- see [[voice-ai-test/kittens|kittens]] for an example
	- filemaker.py: makes a bunch of .md files with a set prompt and a title(useful for making APUSH flashcards)
		- prompts.py: where all the various prompts ive used for filemaker.py are stored
	- append.py: appends a string to all .md files in a folder and subfolders
	- prepend.py: the same as above but prepending
	- linker.py: is supposed to add double brackets(how you link things in obsidian)
		- brackets.py: probably doesnt work idk, supposed to help fix the mistakes linker.py leaves behind
	- replace.py: replaces all of one string with another in a specific file folder and subfolders
	

Once I'm done with the year I'll post the grades I got on everything(and AP Test Sores once those come out)
