Clean up these responses to each of these questions for me

1. Role of the Media: How does the media in Rwanda, both local and international, shape people's perceptions of the conflict? How can geographic proximity to media sources affect a population's response to crises?
    

The media affected hutu extremist through the radio to act on genocide because they were telling hutus all the terrible things tutsis did to them in the past making hutus wanting them to act now. People international were saying that the radio could not cause genocide but people were doing it out of there own will.  
  

2. International Borders: How do the borders of Rwanda and its neighboring countries play a role in the international response to the genocide? What does the film suggest about the role of borders in political and humanitarian intervention?
    

They could either allow or deny refugees entry to the country and give aid to tutsi who were in fear of being killed by hutu extremists. But in the film it didn't seem like they helped because it was an internal affair and it was Rwanda on rwanda death.  
  

3. Geopolitical Responses: In what ways do the responses of the United Nations and the international community illustrate the geopolitical dynamics of humanitarian intervention? How does geography influence global responses to crises?
    

The responses reflect the interest and power structures of various nations as well as strategic importance of the regions affected by crises. The UN as a global governing body plays a crucial role in coordinating international affairs but its effectiveness can be influenced by the political agendas of its member states  
  

4. Impact of Colonialism: How does the film portray the lasting effects of colonialism on the social and political landscape of Rwanda? How do historical geographic boundaries influence the tensions that lead to the genocide?
    

They referenced that colonists employed tutsi to do the dirty work and control the hutus causing them to be vengeful against tutsi even generations later.  
  

5. Ethnic Division and Segregation: How does the film show the geographic and social impact of ethnic segregation in Rwanda? What does this suggest about how geography can reinforce social divisions and inequalities?  
    Its use of physical separation of communities show the hutu and tutsi populations were often divided by geographical barriers and social structures which created an environment ripe for tension and conflict. The film shows that these divisions were reinforced by the layout of the land.
    
6. Human Geography and Reconciliation: How does the film demonstrate the challenges of human geography in the process of reconciliation and rebuilding a divided society? What role does geographic proximity to the site of trauma play in healing and collective memory?
    

IT showcases the physical and emotional landscapes that shape the physical and emotional landscapes that shape individual and personal experiences. It shows how the geographic divisions such as borders can increase levels of  conflict and hinder efforts towards unity between the hutu and tutsi. By showing the struggles of individuals and communities to navigate these divisions.

7. The movie shows a clip of Christine Shelley, the State Department spokesperson, twisting herself into a pretzel to avoid using the “g” word:  
    

Reporter:  How would you describe the events taking place in Rwanda?

State Department Spokesperson:  Based on the evidence we have seen on the ground, we have every reason to believe that acts of genocide have occurred in Rwanda.

Reporter:  What is the difference between “acts of genocide” and “genocide”?

State Department Spokesperson:  Well I think the- as you know there’s a legal definition of this... clearly not all of the killings to which you might apply that label ... But as to the distinctions between the words, we’re trying to call what we have seen so far as best we can; and based again, on the evidence, we have every reason to believe that acts of genocide have occurred.

Reporter:  How many acts of genocide does it take to make genocide?

State Department Spokesperson:  Alan, that’s just not a question that I’m in a position to answer.

Why do you think the US was reluctant to call the events in Rwanda ‘genocide’? 

  
Because they werent able to seperate the definition of acts of genocide and genocide because acts of genocide would be acts towards destroying an ethnic, racial or religious  group. They struggled how to prove how it was genocide because it was rwandan on rwandan crime and killing.
