# Prompt:

Generate a comprehensive SVG diagram of Weak Acid + Strong Base Titration Graph. Respond only with code in an svg code block, do not use comments within your code in order to save space. Include ample padding so that no text overlaps with anything. If the diagram include a graph, include all of the important points. Use the foreignObject tag when creating text boxes so that you can use text wrapping, and to make sure no text overlaps with any object on the screen, and by making sure that the bounds(x,y,y+length,x+width) of the divs inside foreign Objects do not overlaps. In general, try not to make too many text boxes within close proximity of each other.
