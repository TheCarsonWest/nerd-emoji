**Python Recursion**

**Definition:**

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself, breaking a problem down into smaller, similar subproblems until a base case is reached. Each recursive call creates a new stack frame on the call stack.

**Parameters:**

* **Base Case:** A condition that terminates the recursion and returns a result.
* **Recursive Call:** A recursive function call within the original function.
* **Stack Frame:** Memory allocated on the call stack for each recursive call, containing parameters, local variables, and the return address.

**Code Examples:**

**Factorial Calculation (Iterative)**

```python
def factorial_iterative(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

**Factorial Calculation (Recursive)**

```python
def factorial_recursive(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)
```

**Fibonacci Sequence (Recursive)**

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

**Other Python Concepts Related to Recursion:**

* **Stack Frame:** Each recursive call creates a new stack frame on the call stack. A call stack overflow can occur if there are too many recursive calls.
* **Recursion Depth:** The maximum number of recursive calls that can be made without causing a stack overflow. This is platform-dependent.
* **Tail Recursion:** A type of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. Tail recursion can be optimized by the compiler to avoid excessive stack usage.
* **Dynamic Programming:** A technique that stores the results of previous recursive calls in a data structure to avoid redundant calculations. This can improve performance for recursive functions that solve overlapping subproblems.
